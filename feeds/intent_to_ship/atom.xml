    Hi Alex and Blink API OWNERS,

    Can we continue moving forward this discussion? Google&#39;s WebGPU
    team is working with a few partners to ensure their products work
    in WebGPU Compatibility mode to increase their reach, and we&#39;re
    working on gathering their feedback which can be shared publicly.
    But please be assured that this work is already ongoing.

    WebGPU&#39;s Compatibility Mode allows developers to opt-in to a
    slightly reduced API surface and dramatically expand the reach of
    their applications to older Android, Windows and ChromeOS devices.
    All of the major browser vendors have been involved in the
    development of Compatibility Mode for years, and all are in
    agreement that its specification is ready, and that it&#39;s OK to
    ship implementations. (Compatibility Mode wouldn&#39;t have landed in
    the WebGPU specification if there hadn&#39;t been consensus among all
    the vendors.)

    Thanks,

    -Ken

            It&#39;s a little odd that there&#39;s no developer feedback here.

        Fair point. The main impact is just &#38;quot;you can ship on more
        devices&#38;quot;, which developers certainly want, but of course
        WebGPU must still be usable with the restrictions. We /do/
        have positive feedback on that, which we will follow up with
        shortly.

            Is it correct that we&#39;re shipping first?

        Yes, but more than that, we don&#39;t expect all browsers to ship
        it ever. Compatibility mode was specifically designed to
        interoperate as well as possible with other browsers that
        /never/ implement it (Safari), and Safari+Firefox have
        reviewed the API thoroughly in the WG and approved it with
        this in mind. It is expected to be a positive force for WebGPU
        adoption overall as it reduces the need for applications to
        continue to support WebGL.

        Firefox /is/ considering implementing Compatibility Mode, but
        of course it competes with their priorities for other WebGPU
        features. (Compatibility Mode is mostly for old and
        very-low-spec/below-baseline Android devices, which are
        relatively more critical for Chromium as a core Android system
        component.)

            And is there a list of features that will not be available
            in this mode?

        The detailed proposal doc enumerates them:
        
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/blob/main/proposals/compatibility-mode.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/blob/main/proposals/compatibility-mode.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
        That should be complete, but of course the final details are
        in the spec itself.

            Does it unlock software rendering?

        No, only hardware rendering on more devices (that are less
        capable).

        These days, software renderers (WARP, Lavapipe) are among the
        /more/ capable implementations of graphics APIs, since they
        have no hardware dependency and can implement anything with
        sufficient effort (which has been happening).

                        *Summary*
                        Adds an opt-in, lightly restricted subset of
                        the WebGPU API capable of running older
                        graphics APIs such as OpenGL and Direct3D11.
                        By opting into this mode and obeying its
                        constraints, developers can extend the reach
                        of their WebGPU applications to many older
                        devices that do not have the modern, explicit
                        graphics APIs that core WebGPU requires. For
                        simple applications, the only required change
                        is to specify the &#38;quot;compatibility&#38;quot; featureLevel
                        when calling requestAdapter. For more advanced
                        applications, some modifications may be
                        necessary to accommodate the mode&#39;s
                        restrictions. Since Compatibility mode is a
                        subset, the resulting applications are also
                        valid WebGPU Core applications and will run
                        even on user agents that do not support
                        Compatibility mode.

                        *Motivation*
                        WebGPU is a good match for modern graphics
                        APIs such as Vulkan, Metal and Direct3D 12.
                        However, there are a large number of devices
                        which do not yet support those APIs. In
                        particular, on Chrome on Windows, 31% of
                        Chrome users do not have Direct3D FL 11.1 or
                        higher. On Android, 23% of Android users do
                        not have Vulkan 1.1, including 15% who do not
                        have Vulkan at all
                        (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&#34;&#38;gt;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
                        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&#34;&#38;gt;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;).
                        On ChromeOS, Vulkan penetration is still quite
                        low, while OpenGL ES 3.1 is ubiquitous.
                        Developers are thus forced to write multiple
                        implementations (e.g., WebGPU and WebGL) for
                        maximum reach, to accept the reduced reach
                        that core WebGPU currently provides, or to
                        write only for WebGL and forgo the advanced
                        features of WebGPU, such as GPU compute. By
                        opting in to Compatibility Mode, developers
                        can target a wider reach of devices with a
                        single implementation.

                        *Interoperability and Compatibility*
                        This feature has been approved in W3C GPU for
                        the Web WG meetings including participants
                        from Safari and Firefox.

                        /Gecko/: Positive Although there is not
                        currently an entry for Compatibility Mode in
                        the standards positions repos, WebGPU
                        Compatibility Mode was discussed and approved
                        by Google, Apple and Mozilla in the GPU for
                        the Web Working Group, and has the same
                        support as WebGPU Core. Each of the commits to
                        the compatibility-mode propsal above was
                        approved by a working group member from each
                        of those three organizations, and any
                        disagreements were resolved prior to landing
                        in Working Group meetings.

                        *Security*
                        Being a lightly-restricted subset,
                        Compatibility Mode does not introduce any
                        accessibility, security, or privacy issues
                        over and above those introduced by core
                        WebGPU. For this reason, the security review
                        submitted for WebGPU also applies to
                        Compatibility Mode.

                        *WebView application risks*

                        Does this intent deprecate or change behavior
                        of existing APIs, such that it has potentially
                        high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

                        Low; does not remove or alter existing APIs.
                        Provides a lightly-restricted subset of the
                        WebGPU API to older devices which are not
                        capable of the core WebGPU API In case of
                        emergency, there are two independent
                        killswitches: - kWebGPUAndroidOpenGLES
                        controls the Dawn OpenGLES backend on Android
                        in the GPU process - RuntimeEnabledFeature
                        kWebGPUCompatibilityMode controls the JS API
                        in the renderer process


                        *Debuggability*
                        /No information provided/

                        *Will this feature be supported on all six
                        Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux,
                        ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
                        No
                        All platforms will eventually have support.
                        Will immediately be available on Android,
                        Android WebView, ChromeOS, Mac, and Windows,
                        where hardware support is available. Linux is
                        planned to have WebGPU support in the future,
                        so this feature will become available when
                        WebGPU does.

                        *Is this feature fully tested by
                        web-platform-tests
                        
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;?*
                        Yes
                        All Compatibility Mode restrictions are
                        exercised by the &#38;quot;compatibility&#38;quot; option to the
                        WebGPU CTS. E.g.,

                        This subset is tested extensively on the Dawn
                        CI
                        
(&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/chromium.dawn/console&#34;&#38;gt;https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/chromium.dawn/console&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

                        under the &#38;quot;webgpu_cts_compat_tests&#38;quot; suite.
                        WebGPU/WGSL have a conformance test suite

                        regularly pulled into Chromium and part of the
                        testing of Dawn/Tint in Chromium. While the
                        CTS can be embedded in WPT, the WebGPU team
                        opted to keep it separate in Chromium testing
                        to use a customized harness for robustness and
                        performance.

                        *Availability expectation*
                        Mozilla is interested in this feature (and has
                        approved all of the spec changes) but has not
                        committed to implementing it yet. Apple has
                        approved all of the spec changes, but it is
                        not anticipated that this feature will ship in
                        Safari since all Apple devices on the market
                        can support the full Core WebGPU spec.
                        However, since it is designed as a subset,
                        Compatibility mode applications will work
                        unchanged in browsers that only support Core
                        (e.g., Safari).

                        *Adoption expectation*
                        Feature is used by specific partner(s) to
                        provide functionality within 12 months of
                        launch in Chrome.

                        *Adoption plan*
                        Adoption of Core WebGPU proceeds apace
                        
(&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4029&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4029&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
                        
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4029&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4029&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;),
                        and it is expected that developers will adopt
                        Compatibility Mode because it allows them to
                        extend the reach of their WebGPU content to a
                        larger audience.

                        *Non-OSS dependencies*

                        Does the feature depend on any code or APIs
                        outside the Chromium open source repository
                        and its open-source dependencies to function?

                        On Android, this feature depends on the
                        OpenGLES 3.1 graphics API in order to provide
                        WebGPU capability to older devices. The
                        JavaScript API will be available on all
                        platforms, including desktop, but will not
                        require any new graphics APIs; it will simply
                        allow developers to test the Compatibility
                        Mode subset on all Chrome platforms.

                        *Anticipated spec changes*

                        Open questions about a feature may be a source
                        of future web compat or interop issues. Please
                        list open issues (e.g. links to known github
                        issues in the project for the feature
                        specification) whose resolution may introduce
                        web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to
                        naming or structure of the API in a
                        non-backward-compatible way).

                        All Compatibility Mode changes have landed in
                        the WebGPU core spec:

        Thanks for acknowledging the mistake and sending this
        retroactively Martin. No concerns with the intent from me, LGTM1.

        Sorry we didn&#39;t have any way in our &#39;webexposed&#39; tests to
        double-check for approvals for this sort of new feature
        (JSON-schema only change to the argument of a web-exposed
        API). I don&#39;t see any reliable and low-friction check we could
        add for cases like this, so I think we should just chalk this
        up as a known limitation of our heuristics. Mistakes like this
        do happen occasionally but IMHO they are extremely rare so not
        something I think we need to take special action on.

            Hello API Owners,

            This feature was launched on Desktop in Chrome 136 and
            Android in 142, and we unfortunately forgot to request
            Intent to Ship approvals. I just realized this mistake
            while we were cleaning up old feature flags, my apologies.
            Are there any concerns or could we please have retroactive
            LGTMs?

            For context, this was an additional feature to WebAuthn
            that had an already existing spec and an implementation in
            WebKit. Several large Relying Parties have adopted it already.

            Thanks,
            Martin Kreichgauer

                *Summary*
                WebAuthn Conditional Create allows websites to
                automatically create passkeys for existing users that
                have a matching password saved in their password manager.

                *Motivation*
                WebAuthn Conditional Create requests let a website
                (aka a Relying Party or RP) create a passkey without
                prominent modal mediation, if the user has previously
                consented to credential creation. The motivating use
                case is commonly referred to as &#38;quot;passkey upgrades&#38;quot;.
                I.e., if the browser/credential manager already stores
                an existing password credential for the same
                website/relying party and user, conditional create
                allows the the website automatically create a matching
                passkey. An explainer with more information is hosted
                in the W3C WebAuthn wiki:

*Specification*

*Summary*
The HTML5 Drag and Drop API allows web applications to handle drag-and-drop 
operations through a series of events: `dragstart`, `dragenter`, 
`dragover`, `dragleave`, `drop`, and `dragend`. During these events, the 
[`dataTransfer.dropEffect`](
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/dnd.html#dom-datatransfer-dropeffect&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/dnd.html#dom-datatransfer-dropeffect&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
 
property indicates which operation (copy, move, link, or none) should be 
performed. According to the [HTML5 specification](
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/dnd.html#dndevents&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/dnd.html#dndevents&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;), the 
`dropEffect` value set by web applications during the last `dragover` event 
should be preserved and available in the subsequent `drop` event. However, 
Chromium-based browsers were overwriting the web application&#39;s `dropEffect` 
value with the browser&#39;s own negotiated operation before the `drop` event 
fired, breaking specification compliance and limiting developer control 
over drag-and-drop behavior.


That spec link is quite outdated; it points to the 2011 snapshot. I&#39;m 
curious if the spec has been updated since then.

*Motivation*
The current behavior: - Violates the HTML5 specification: Contradicts the 
standardized behavior defined in the HTML5 Drag and Drop API - Breaks 
developer control: Removes the ability for web applications to manage their 
own drag-and-drop operations - Creates unpredictable UX: The operation 
indicated during drag (via cursor feedback) may not match what&#39;s available 
in the drop handler - Forces workarounds: Developers must store 
`dropEffect` values in global variables or custom data attributes rather 
than using the standard API - Limits functionality: Makes it impossible to 
build spec-compliant file managers, code editors, and other applications 
requiring sophisticated drag-and-drop

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Don&#39;t see any updates here since Jul 2025 although this shows up in the 
added feature list in Chrome 143. Is there a dev trial available at this 
point to try this out ? If not, is there any information on the timeline?

&#38;gt; Thanks Jeffrey, that&#39;s a good point and one we&#39;ve considered. We&#39;ll 
&#38;gt; definitely be reaching out to those vendors as we seek feedback and 
&#38;gt; alignment (and I&#39;m sure the list will grow by the time we get to I2S).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Our team recently published a very similar explainer at

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would you be interested in collaborating in this area further at WICG?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Indeed, happy that we converged to basically the same place :)
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; We&#39;d be happy to collaborate!

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thanks for working on this, and it&#39;s good to see that Microsoft is also 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interested. I wanted to note that, as this gets closer to an Intent to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Ship, the &#38;quot;Interoperability and Compatibility&#38;quot; section might need to focus 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; on some entities that haven&#39;t traditionally been relevant to I2Ses. This 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API is for agentic browsers, so the relevant groups are the ones building 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; agents, like Perplexity, Open AI, etc.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hi Alex,

I&#39;ve added a statement from Unity to the &#38;quot;Web / Framework developer views
notes&#38;quot;. Unity is an important partner, so this carries some weight. We will
add more if/when it comes in.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adds an opt-in, lightly restricted subset of the WebGPU API capable of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; running older graphics APIs such as OpenGL and Direct3D11. By opting into
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this mode and obeying its constraints, developers can extend the reach of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their WebGPU applications to many older devices that do not have the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; modern, explicit graphics APIs that core WebGPU requires. For simple
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; applications, the only required change is to specify the &#38;quot;compatibility&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; featureLevel when calling requestAdapter. For more advanced applications,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the mode&#39;s restrictions.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Since Compatibility mode is a subset, the resulting applications are also
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; valid WebGPU Core applications and will run even on user agents that do not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; support Compatibility mode.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebGPU is a good match for modern graphics APIs such as Vulkan, Metal
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and Direct3D 12. However, there are a large number of devices which do not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; yet support those APIs. In particular, on Chrome on Windows, 31% of Chrome
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; users do not have Direct3D FL 11.1 or higher. On Android, 23% of Android
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; users do not have Vulkan 1.1, including 15% who do not have Vulkan at all (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&#34;&#38;gt;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;). On ChromeOS, Vulkan
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; penetration is still quite low, while OpenGL ES 3.1 is ubiquitous.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Developers are thus forced to write multiple implementations (e.g., WebGPU
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and WebGL) for maximum reach, to accept the reduced reach that core WebGPU
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; currently provides, or to write only for WebGL and forgo the advanced
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; features of WebGPU, such as GPU compute. By opting in to Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mode, developers can target a wider reach of devices with a single
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature has been approved in W3C GPU for the Web WG meetings
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; including participants from Safari and Firefox.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Gecko*: Positive Although there is not currently an entry for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Compatibility Mode in the standards positions repos, WebGPU Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mode was discussed and approved by Google, Apple and Mozilla in the GPU for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the Web Working Group, and has the same support as WebGPU Core. Each of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; commits to the compatibility-mode propsal above was approved by a working
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; group member from each of those three organizations, and any disagreements
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; were resolved prior to landing in Working Group meetings.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebKit*: Positive Although there is not currently an entry for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Compatibility Mode in the standards positions repos, WebGPU Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mode was discussed and approved by Google, Apple and Mozilla in the GPU for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the Web Working Group, and has the same support as WebGPU Core. Each of the

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Other signals*:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Being a lightly-restricted subset, Compatibility Mode does not introduce
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; any accessibility, security, or privacy issues over and above those
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduced by core WebGPU. For this reason, the security review submitted
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for WebGPU also applies to Compatibility Mode.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Low; does not remove or alter existing APIs. Provides a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lightly-restricted subset of the WebGPU API to older devices which are not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; capable of the core WebGPU API In case of emergency, there are two
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; independent killswitches: - kWebGPUAndroidOpenGLES controls the Dawn
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; OpenGLES backend on Android in the GPU process - RuntimeEnabledFeature
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; kWebGPUCompatibilityMode controls the JS API in the renderer process

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *No information provided*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; All platforms will eventually have support. Will immediately be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; available on Android, Android WebView, ChromeOS, Mac, and Windows, where
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; hardware support is available. Linux is planned to have WebGPU support in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the future, so this feature will become available when WebGPU does.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; All Compatibility Mode restrictions are exercised by the &#38;quot;compatibility&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; option to the WebGPU CTS. E.g., &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://gpuweb.github.io/cts/&#34;&#38;gt;https://gpuweb.github.io/cts/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; standalone/?compatibility=1&#38;amp;q=webgpu:* This subset is tested
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; extensively on the Dawn CI (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://ci.chromium.org/p/&#34;&#38;gt;https://ci.chromium.org/p/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; chromium/g/chromium.dawn/console) under the &#38;quot;webgpu_cts_compat_tests&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; suite. WebGPU/WGSL have a conformance test suite (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/gpuweb/cts&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/gpuweb/cts&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) that is regularly pulled into Chromium
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and part of the testing of Dawn/Tint in Chromium. While the CTS can be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; embedded in WPT, the WebGPU team opted to keep it separate in Chromium
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; testing to use a customized harness for robustness and performance.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mozilla is interested in this feature (and has approved all of the spec
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; changes) but has not committed to implementing it yet. Apple has approved
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; all of the spec changes, but it is not anticipated that this feature will
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ship in Safari since all Apple devices on the market can support the full
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Core WebGPU spec. However, since it is designed as a subset, Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mode applications will work unchanged in browsers that only support Core
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (e.g., Safari).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Feature is used by specific partner(s) to provide functionality within
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 12 months of launch in Chrome.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption plan*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adoption of Core WebGPU proceeds apace (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4029), and it is expected that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers will adopt Compatibility Mode because it allows them to extend
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the reach of their WebGPU content to a larger audience.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; On Android, this feature depends on the OpenGLES 3.1 graphics API in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; order to provide WebGPU capability to older devices. The JavaScript API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will be available on all platforms, including desktop, but will not require
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; any new graphics APIs; it will simply allow developers to test the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Compatibility Mode subset on all Chrome platforms.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; All Compatibility Mode changes have landed in the WebGPU core spec:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Don&#39;t see any updates here since Jul 2025 although this shows up in the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; added feature list in Chrome 143. Is there a dev trial available at this 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; point to try this out ? If not, is there any information on the timeline?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thanks Jeffrey, that&#39;s a good point and one we&#39;ve considered. We&#39;ll 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; definitely be reaching out to those vendors as we seek feedback and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; alignment (and I&#39;m sure the list will grow by the time we get to I2S).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would you be interested in collaborating in this area further at WICG?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Indeed, happy that we converged to basically the same place :)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;d be happy to collaborate!

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thanks for working on this, and it&#39;s good to see that Microsoft is also 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interested. I wanted to note that, as this gets closer to an Intent to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Ship, the &#38;quot;Interoperability and Compatibility&#38;quot; section might need to focus 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; on some entities that haven&#39;t traditionally been relevant to I2Ses. This 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API is for agentic browsers, so the relevant groups are the ones building 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; agents, like Perplexity, Open AI, etc.

&#38;gt; Hi Alex,
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; I&#39;ve added a statement from Unity to the &#38;quot;Web / Framework developer views
&#38;gt; notes&#38;quot;. Unity is an important partner, so this carries some weight. We will
&#38;gt; add more if/when it comes in.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It&#39;s a little odd that there&#39;s no developer feedback here. Is it correct
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that we&#39;re shipping first? And is there a list of features that will not be

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adds an opt-in, lightly restricted subset of the WebGPU API capable of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; running older graphics APIs such as OpenGL and Direct3D11. By opting into
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this mode and obeying its constraints, developers can extend the reach of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their WebGPU applications to many older devices that do not have the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; modern, explicit graphics APIs that core WebGPU requires. For simple
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; applications, the only required change is to specify the &#38;quot;compatibility&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; featureLevel when calling requestAdapter. For more advanced applications,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the mode&#39;s restrictions.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Since Compatibility mode is a subset, the resulting applications are also
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; valid WebGPU Core applications and will run even on user agents that do not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; support Compatibility mode.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebGPU is a good match for modern graphics APIs such as Vulkan, Metal
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and Direct3D 12. However, there are a large number of devices which do not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; yet support those APIs. In particular, on Chrome on Windows, 31% of Chrome
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; users do not have Direct3D FL 11.1 or higher. On Android, 23% of Android
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; users do not have Vulkan 1.1, including 15% who do not have Vulkan at all (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&#34;&#38;gt;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;). On ChromeOS, Vulkan
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; penetration is still quite low, while OpenGL ES 3.1 is ubiquitous.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Developers are thus forced to write multiple implementations (e.g., WebGPU
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and WebGL) for maximum reach, to accept the reduced reach that core WebGPU
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; currently provides, or to write only for WebGL and forgo the advanced
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; features of WebGPU, such as GPU compute. By opting in to Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mode, developers can target a wider reach of devices with a single
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature has been approved in W3C GPU for the Web WG meetings
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; including participants from Safari and Firefox.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Gecko*: Positive Although there is not currently an entry for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Compatibility Mode in the standards positions repos, WebGPU Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mode was discussed and approved by Google, Apple and Mozilla in the GPU for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the Web Working Group, and has the same support as WebGPU Core. Each of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; commits to the compatibility-mode propsal above was approved by a working
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; group member from each of those three organizations, and any disagreements
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; were resolved prior to landing in Working Group meetings.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebKit*: Positive Although there is not currently an entry for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Compatibility Mode in the standards positions repos, WebGPU Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mode was discussed and approved by Google, Apple and Mozilla in the GPU for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the Web Working Group, and has the same support as WebGPU Core. Each of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; commits to the compatibility-mode propsal above was approved by a working

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; were resolved prior to landing in Working Group meetings.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Web developers*: No signals
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Other signals*:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Being a lightly-restricted subset, Compatibility Mode does not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce any accessibility, security, or privacy issues over and above
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; those introduced by core WebGPU. For this reason, the security review
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; submitted for WebGPU also applies to Compatibility Mode.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Low; does not remove or alter existing APIs. Provides a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lightly-restricted subset of the WebGPU API to older devices which are not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; capable of the core WebGPU API In case of emergency, there are two
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; independent killswitches: - kWebGPUAndroidOpenGLES controls the Dawn
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; OpenGLES backend on Android in the GPU process - RuntimeEnabledFeature
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; kWebGPUCompatibilityMode controls the JS API in the renderer process
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *No information provided*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; All platforms will eventually have support. Will immediately be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; available on Android, Android WebView, ChromeOS, Mac, and Windows, where
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; hardware support is available. Linux is planned to have WebGPU support in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the future, so this feature will become available when WebGPU does.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; All Compatibility Mode restrictions are exercised by the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;compatibility&#38;quot; option to the WebGPU CTS. E.g.,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://gpuweb.github.io/cts/standalone/?compatibility=1&#38;amp;q=webgpu:*&#34;&#38;gt;https://gpuweb.github.io/cts/standalone/?compatibility=1&#38;amp;q=webgpu:*&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This subset is tested extensively on the Dawn CI (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/chromium.dawn/console&#34;&#38;gt;https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/chromium.dawn/console&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) under the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;webgpu_cts_compat_tests&#38;quot; suite. WebGPU/WGSL have a conformance test suite 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/gpuweb/cts&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/gpuweb/cts&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) that is regularly pulled into Chromium
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and part of the testing of Dawn/Tint in Chromium. While the CTS can be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; embedded in WPT, the WebGPU team opted to keep it separate in Chromium
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; testing to use a customized harness for robustness and performance.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will ship enabled for all users
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mozilla is interested in this feature (and has approved all of the spec
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; changes) but has not committed to implementing it yet. Apple has approved
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; all of the spec changes, but it is not anticipated that this feature will
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ship in Safari since all Apple devices on the market can support the full
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Core WebGPU spec. However, since it is designed as a subset, Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mode applications will work unchanged in browsers that only support Core
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (e.g., Safari).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Feature is used by specific partner(s) to provide functionality within
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 12 months of launch in Chrome.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption plan*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adoption of Core WebGPU proceeds apace (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4029), and it is expected that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers will adopt Compatibility Mode because it allows them to extend
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the reach of their WebGPU content to a larger audience.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; On Android, this feature depends on the OpenGLES 3.1 graphics API in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; order to provide WebGPU capability to older devices. The JavaScript API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will be available on all platforms, including desktop, but will not require
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; any new graphics APIs; it will simply allow developers to test the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Compatibility Mode subset on all Chrome platforms.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; All Compatibility Mode changes have landed in the WebGPU core spec:

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;This simple API plugs a missing piece of functionality: there is no way to 
tell WebRTC that you may want to use data channels at some point in the 
future without having to re-negotiate, so the only way to ensure you 
negotiate data channels unconditionally is to create these dummy data 
channels not to be intended for use that you have to manually ignore at the 
other endpoint, both with regards to events firing and when parsing 
statistics.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Creating dummy data channels is a workaround to a mistake in the API in my 
opinion, and I would support it even if all that it achieved was API 
ergonomics.

But it does achieve something more than the workaround is able to: placing 
the m= application line at the top. The fact that the order of m= sections 
is more predictable reduces the risk of application bugs. I believe Google 
Meet had a serious regression a few years ago where the m= section order 
was something not what we expected causing the SDP parser to fail and the 
call to be disconnected. It&#39;s also a good idea that the m= application line 
gets tagged, avoiding risk of rejecting the whole bundle if the wrong m= 
section is rejected.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This is generally why we require explainers. Part of the point of this

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The specification just says &#38;quot;alwaysNegotiateDataChannels defines a way 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for the application to negotiate data channels in the SDP offer before 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; creating a datachannel&#38;quot;. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;m finding it a bit hard to reason about what this means for me as a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developer. I.e. when should I set it and how does this change the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; connection?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Lets say you create a RTCPeerConnection. Create an offer and call 
&#38;gt; setLocalDescription. Send it to your peer. You get an answer from the peer 
&#38;gt; and feed it into setRemoteDescription.
&#38;gt; You might wonder why it does not result in a connection.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Next, you create a datachannel. Your datachannel never opens because after 
&#38;gt; adding the datachannel (only the first!) you need to call 
&#38;gt; createOffer/setLocalDescription and call setRemoteDescription with the 
&#38;gt; answer.
&#38;gt; &#38;quot;web developers&#38;quot; are notably confused:
&#38;gt;   
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79737908/how-do-i-create-a-data-channel-in-webrtc-js-firefox-115-6-esr&#34;&#38;gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79737908/how-do-i-create-a-data-channel-in-webrtc-js-firefox-115-6-esr&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Now your connection gets established. If you add another data channel you 
&#38;gt; do *not* need to do this negotiation again (thankfully; adding audio or 
&#38;gt; video tracks requires negotiation).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; In this case using the boolean flag is saving you one round of negotiation.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; In many applications you do not know if you want to use a datachannel but 
&#38;gt; since you might, you preemptively create one and throw it away. You can see 
&#38;gt; that e.g. in Google Meet which calls
&#38;gt;    pc.createDataChannel(&#38;quot;ignored&#38;quot;, {reliable: true})
&#38;gt; It never uses that channel but it shows up in the getStats API every time.
&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this mean that a data channel will be negotiated without calling 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; createDataChannel?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The underlying SCTP association will be negotiated and can be used by 
&#38;gt; subsequent calls to createDataChannel without renegotiation.
&#38;gt; This currently means exchanging four packets over the network (but that 
&#38;gt; upfront cost might go away later this year).
&#38;gt; Everything is set up to just work.
&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will that requested datachannel result in a datachannel event or does my 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; code still need to call createDataChannel? If the latter, is this a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; performance optimization? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Part of it is a performance / ergonomics optimization. But behold, there 
&#38;gt; comes the 2011 backward compat angle below.
&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would I choose this when data is more important to connect first rather 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; than e.g. voice / video?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Lets say you have a stream from getUserMedia with audio and video and 
&#38;gt; would also like to have a datachannel.
&#38;gt; You call pc.createDataChannel and then iterate over the MediaStream&#39;s 
&#38;gt; getTracks and call pc.addTrack with each.
&#38;gt; Because data channels were new and fancy in 2011 and backward compat was a 
&#38;gt; concern this results in SDP (due to rules in RFC 8829) which puts the 
&#38;gt; datachannel bits in the SDP after the audio and video bits (and in Safari 
&#38;gt; the order of audio and video bits depend on the lexical ordering of the 
&#38;gt; random uuid of the MediaStreamTrack) so the SDP looks roughly like this:
&#38;gt;   v=0 (6 more lines)
&#38;gt;   m=audio 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 63 111 (23 more lines) direction=sendonly 
&#38;gt; mid=0
&#38;gt;   m=video 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96 97 98 99 100 101 45 46 (63 more lines) 
&#38;gt; direction=sendonly mid=1
&#38;gt;   m=application 9 UDP/DTLS/SCTP webrtc-datachannel (9 more lines) 
&#38;gt; direction=sendrecv mid=2
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Which is ok but you are probably scratching your head why this order does 
&#38;gt; not match the order of calls (or why in Safari you get 
&#38;gt; video-audio-application half the time)
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8829.html#name-initial-offers&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8829.html#name-initial-offers&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; specifies 
&#38;gt; this (search for &#38;quot;Lastly, &#38;quot;) but does not provide much of a rationale. 
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; has some 2016 rationale.
&#38;gt; Now that seems like an odd choice but had little consequence until...
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The linked tracking bug &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/433898678&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/433898678&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appears 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to be a chrome-only bug report with a particular demo that doesn&#39;t use the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; alwaysNegotiateDataChannels attribute and works on Firefox. I don&#39;t quite 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; understand what the new configuration extension has to do with the original 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; bug report.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; WebRTC added APIs that allow you to negotiate codecs at some point. This 
&#38;gt; can result in a situation where you end up with a incompatible set of video 
&#38;gt; codecs (see the bug) and if those happen to be first in the SDP this &#38;quot;m=&#38;quot; 
&#38;gt; line will be marked as &#38;quot;rejected&#38;quot; and can not be used to convey the 
&#38;gt; transport information anymore.
&#38;gt; At best this results in another round of negotiation to satisfy
&#38;gt;   
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Now 
&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; actually provides a recommendation on how to avoid this: you pick 
&#38;gt; something that is &#38;quot;unlikely to be rejected by the remote side&#38;quot;.
&#38;gt; The browser does not have an API that would lead to it rejecting a 
&#38;gt; datachannel m= line (which can happen for audio and video)
&#38;gt; So it would be great to pick this datachannel m= line as &#38;quot;offerer tagged&#38;quot; 
&#38;gt; which avoids this headache.
&#38;gt; But that requires (unless you want to risk more breakage) putting this m= 
&#38;gt; line first which is conflicts with the rules of RFC 8829.
&#38;gt; The alternative is going through at least two rounds of negotiation (which 
&#38;gt; involves the remote end), the first datachannel only and then adding media.
&#38;gt; Hence you need a way to opt-in which is the boolean in the 
&#38;gt; RTCConfiguration.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Would you like to hear more about why WebRTC is so weird? (a lot of this 
&#38;gt; boils down to &#38;quot;SDP is not an opaque blob)

&#38;gt; Is there anything blocking getting the spec PR landed?
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Actually, no. Possibly minor editorial things I need to wade through, but
otherwise no. I&#39;ll get on landing it.

I think it&#39;s probably fine not to block on WPT tests for landing this, but
&#38;gt; if Mozilla is (as you say) likely to start working on an implementation
&#38;gt; over the next year then I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;d prefer we explore the
&#38;gt; feasibility of adding WPT infrastructure.


Right, this API is still a priority and staffed, so if such a signal comes
in, getting all the WPT infrastructure worked out will become a priority
and something we will lead, since the utility will be clear.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; DevTools integration seems like good follow up work - but given the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ephemeral (~session storage-like) nature of the storage, it seems easy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; enough to clear state as-is.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A new key-value API, tentatively `window.crashReport`, backed by a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; per-Document map holding data that gets appended to crash reports. See
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/15&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/15&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; for initial
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; discussion. The data placed in this API&#39;s backing map gets sent in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `CrashReportBody` [1] if any renderer process crashes are incurred by the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; site. This lets developers debug what specific state in their application
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; might be causing a given crash. [1]:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The Crash Reporting API (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) allows
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers to know when their site is crashing in the wild, and get some
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; very rudimentary information associated with each crash. But developers
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; don&#39;t have enough to go off to debug the crash further. The feature
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; allows developers to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; get a JavaScript stack trace, but only for unresponsive crashes. Outside of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this narrow case, developers have a hard time tying their specific logic or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; features to a real-world crash. The `window.crashReport` API exposes a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; light-weight key-value store that developers can use to store breadcrumbs
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of their app state, which get appended to crash reports that get sent to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their developer-specified endpoints. This significantly helps developers
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; pinpoint the cause of a crash they&#39;re seeing in the wild, and radically
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; speed up their debugging cycle.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; infrastructure (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/288&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/288&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and I&#39;ve received positive, informal feedback in Web Perf WG when
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; presenting this and asking Firefox engineers for feedback.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; are not specific to this sub-API; they are concerned about the overall
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crash reporting infrastructure.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *No information provided*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature could benefit by DevTools integration, to help developers
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; more ergonomically interact with data in the crash report storage. We&#39;re
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; considering this integration as a follow-up to support our partners, in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; first half of 2026.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature is not fully testable with Web Platform Tests, because WPT
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; infrastructure does not provide the ability to crash specific renderer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; processes. This limitation has not prevented the Crash Report
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Infrastructure from shipping in general, nor has it prevented additions
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; like &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;. This API will be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; tested with as many web platform tests as possible to assert the shape and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; semantics of the JS-exposed web API.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; My expectation is that the feature is available only in Chromium browsers
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for at least 12 months, with a possible (seems likely) implementation in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Firefox to follow.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We expect the feature to be used by a very small number of large partners
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with uniquely complicated, memory-intensive web applications, and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comprehensive client and server-side debugging infrastructure. These
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners will be using the API well within 12 months of launch in Chrome.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Estimated milestones*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Shipping on desktop 145
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Origin trial desktop first 140
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Origin trial desktop last 142
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Origin trial extension 1 end milestone 145

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Anticipated spec changes*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re considering ergonomic additions to the API in the near future, such
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; as: - The ability to retrieve keys placed in the crash storage - The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ability to reset the storage entirely (freeing it), and re-request a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; different amount later The API has been designed in a way that does not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; preclude any of these additions.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Thank you for the explanation. I definitely agree that this sounds very
important. My concern remains that the parameter name and
developer documentation does not convey this and without this context it&#39;s
unclear why I should use this. As an example, the config parameter could
just be called negotiateDataChannels, as a cue that this will ensure your
connection is configured to support creating data channels. It would be
worth also explaining why you want to do this, with a short snippet showing
how a data channel can be added later.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

The spec says that it is negotiated before audio or video but doesn&#39;t
explain why you might want to do this - i.e. to ensure that you can
negotiate a connection even if the audio or video channels fail to
negotiate a compatible codec.

TLDR; I&#39;m not opposed to this feature - after learning what it does and
why, I agree we need it. I just think it would be very hard for someone
reading about this to understand that they should use it to resolve these
issues.

&#38;gt; This simple API plugs a missing piece of functionality: there is no way to
&#38;gt; tell WebRTC that you may want to use data channels at some point in the
&#38;gt; future without having to re-negotiate, so the only way to ensure you
&#38;gt; negotiate data channels unconditionally is to create these dummy data
&#38;gt; channels not to be intended for use that you have to manually ignore at the
&#38;gt; other endpoint, both with regards to events firing and when parsing
&#38;gt; statistics.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Creating dummy data channels is a workaround to a mistake in the API in my
&#38;gt; opinion, and I would support it even if all that it achieved was API
&#38;gt; ergonomics.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; But it does achieve something more than the workaround is able to: placing
&#38;gt; the m= application line at the top. The fact that the order of m= sections
&#38;gt; is more predictable reduces the risk of application bugs. I believe Google
&#38;gt; Meet had a serious regression a few years ago where the m= section order
&#38;gt; was something not what we expected causing the SDP parser to fail and the
&#38;gt; call to be disconnected. It&#39;s also a good idea that the m= application line
&#38;gt; gets tagged, avoiding risk of rejecting the whole bundle if the wrong m=
&#38;gt; section is rejected.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; connection?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Lets say you create a RTCPeerConnection. Create an offer and call
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; setLocalDescription. Send it to your peer. You get an answer from the peer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and feed it into setRemoteDescription.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You might wonder why it does not result in a connection.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Next, you create a datachannel. Your datachannel never opens because
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; after adding the datachannel (only the first!) you need to call
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; createOffer/setLocalDescription and call setRemoteDescription with the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; answer.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;web developers&#38;quot; are notably confused:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79737908/how-do-i-create-a-data-channel-in-webrtc-js-firefox-115-6-esr&#34;&#38;gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79737908/how-do-i-create-a-data-channel-in-webrtc-js-firefox-115-6-esr&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now your connection gets established. If you add another data channel you
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; do *not* need to do this negotiation again (thankfully; adding audio or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video tracks requires negotiation).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In this case using the boolean flag is saving you one round of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In many applications you do not know if you want to use a datachannel but
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; since you might, you preemptively create one and throw it away. You can see
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that e.g. in Google Meet which calls
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    pc.createDataChannel(&#38;quot;ignored&#38;quot;, {reliable: true})
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It never uses that channel but it shows up in the getStats API every time.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this mean that a data channel will be negotiated without calling
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; createDataChannel?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The underlying SCTP association will be negotiated and can be used by
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; subsequent calls to createDataChannel without renegotiation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This currently means exchanging four packets over the network (but that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; upfront cost might go away later this year).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Everything is set up to just work.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will that requested datachannel result in a datachannel event or does my
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; code still need to call createDataChannel? If the latter, is this a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; performance optimization?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Part of it is a performance / ergonomics optimization. But behold, there
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comes the 2011 backward compat angle below.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would I choose this when data is more important to connect first rather
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; than e.g. voice / video?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Lets say you have a stream from getUserMedia with audio and video and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; would also like to have a datachannel.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You call pc.createDataChannel and then iterate over the MediaStream&#39;s
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; getTracks and call pc.addTrack with each.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Because data channels were new and fancy in 2011 and backward compat was
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a concern this results in SDP (due to rules in RFC 8829) which puts the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel bits in the SDP after the audio and video bits (and in Safari
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the order of audio and video bits depend on the lexical ordering of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; random uuid of the MediaStreamTrack) so the SDP looks roughly like this:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   v=0 (6 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=audio 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 63 111 (23 more lines) direction=sendonly
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mid=0
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=video 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96 97 98 99 100 101 45 46 (63 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; direction=sendonly mid=1
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=application 9 UDP/DTLS/SCTP webrtc-datachannel (9 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; direction=sendrecv mid=2
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Which is ok but you are probably scratching your head why this order does
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; not match the order of calls (or why in Safari you get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video-audio-application half the time)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specifies this (search for &#38;quot;Lastly, &#38;quot;) but does not provide much of a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rationale. &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; has some 2016
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rationale.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now that seems like an odd choice but had little consequence until...
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The linked tracking bug &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/433898678&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/433898678&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appears to be a chrome-only bug report with a particular demo that doesn&#39;t
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; use the alwaysNegotiateDataChannels attribute and works on Firefox. I don&#39;t
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; quite understand what the new configuration extension has to do with the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; original bug report.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebRTC added APIs that allow you to negotiate codecs at some point. This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; can result in a situation where you end up with a incompatible set of video
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; codecs (see the bug) and if those happen to be first in the SDP this &#38;quot;m=&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; line will be marked as &#38;quot;rejected&#38;quot; and can not be used to convey the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; transport information anymore.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; At best this results in another round of negotiation to satisfy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; actually provides a recommendation on how to avoid this: you pick
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; something that is &#38;quot;unlikely to be rejected by the remote side&#38;quot;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The browser does not have an API that would lead to it rejecting a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel m= line (which can happen for audio and video)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; So it would be great to pick this datachannel m= line as &#38;quot;offerer tagged&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which avoids this headache.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But that requires (unless you want to risk more breakage) putting this m=
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; line first which is conflicts with the rules of RFC 8829.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The alternative is going through at least two rounds of negotiation
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (which involves the remote end), the first datachannel only and then adding
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; media.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hence you need a way to opt-in which is the boolean in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RTCConfiguration.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would you like to hear more about why WebRTC is so weird? (a lot of this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; boils down to &#38;quot;SDP is not an opaque blob)

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Sorry, quick followup, keeping always in the name would make sense if it
was explained that because this is negotiated first it ensures that we at
least will always negotiate a data channel even if audio and video fail.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; Thank you for the explanation. I definitely agree that this sounds very
&#38;gt; important. My concern remains that the parameter name and
&#38;gt; developer documentation does not convey this and without this context it&#39;s
&#38;gt; unclear why I should use this. As an example, the config parameter could
&#38;gt; just be called negotiateDataChannels, as a cue that this will ensure your
&#38;gt; connection is configured to support creating data channels. It would be
&#38;gt; worth also explaining why you want to do this, with a short snippet showing
&#38;gt; how a data channel can be added later.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The spec says that it is negotiated before audio or video but doesn&#39;t
&#38;gt; explain why you might want to do this - i.e. to ensure that you can
&#38;gt; negotiate a connection even if the audio or video channels fail to
&#38;gt; negotiate a compatible codec.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; TLDR; I&#39;m not opposed to this feature - after learning what it does and
&#38;gt; why, I agree we need it. I just think it would be very hard for someone
&#38;gt; reading about this to understand that they should use it to resolve these
&#38;gt; issues.

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This simple API plugs a missing piece of functionality: there is no way
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to tell WebRTC that you may want to use data channels at some point in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; future without having to re-negotiate, so the only way to ensure you
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiate data channels unconditionally is to create these dummy data
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; channels not to be intended for use that you have to manually ignore at the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; other endpoint, both with regards to events firing and when parsing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; statistics.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Creating dummy data channels is a workaround to a mistake in the API in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; my opinion, and I would support it even if all that it achieved was API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ergonomics.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But it does achieve something more than the workaround is able to:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; placing the m= application line at the top. The fact that the order of m=
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sections is more predictable reduces the risk of application bugs. I
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; believe Google Meet had a serious regression a few years ago where the m=
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; section order was something not what we expected causing the SDP parser to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fail and the call to be disconnected. It&#39;s also a good idea that the m=
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application line gets tagged, avoiding risk of rejecting the whole bundle
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if the wrong m= section is rejected.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The specification just says &#38;quot;alwaysNegotiateDataChannels defines a way
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for the application to negotiate data channels in the SDP offer before
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; creating a datachannel&#38;quot;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;m finding it a bit hard to reason about what this means for me as a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developer. I.e. when should I set it and how does this change the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; connection?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Lets say you create a RTCPeerConnection. Create an offer and call
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; setLocalDescription. Send it to your peer. You get an answer from the peer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and feed it into setRemoteDescription.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You might wonder why it does not result in a connection.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Next, you create a datachannel. Your datachannel never opens because
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; after adding the datachannel (only the first!) you need to call
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; createOffer/setLocalDescription and call setRemoteDescription with the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; answer.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;web developers&#38;quot; are notably confused:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79737908/how-do-i-create-a-data-channel-in-webrtc-js-firefox-115-6-esr&#34;&#38;gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79737908/how-do-i-create-a-data-channel-in-webrtc-js-firefox-115-6-esr&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now your connection gets established. If you add another data channel
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you do *not* need to do this negotiation again (thankfully; adding audio or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video tracks requires negotiation).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In this case using the boolean flag is saving you one round of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In many applications you do not know if you want to use a datachannel
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but since you might, you preemptively create one and throw it away. You can
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; see that e.g. in Google Meet which calls
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    pc.createDataChannel(&#38;quot;ignored&#38;quot;, {reliable: true})
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It never uses that channel but it shows up in the getStats API every
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; time.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this mean that a data channel will be negotiated without calling
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; createDataChannel?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The underlying SCTP association will be negotiated and can be used by
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; subsequent calls to createDataChannel without renegotiation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This currently means exchanging four packets over the network (but that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; upfront cost might go away later this year).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Everything is set up to just work.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will that requested datachannel result in a datachannel event or does
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; my code still need to call createDataChannel? If the latter, is this a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; performance optimization?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Part of it is a performance / ergonomics optimization. But behold, there
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comes the 2011 backward compat angle below.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would I choose this when data is more important to connect first rather
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; than e.g. voice / video?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Lets say you have a stream from getUserMedia with audio and video and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; would also like to have a datachannel.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You call pc.createDataChannel and then iterate over the MediaStream&#39;s
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; getTracks and call pc.addTrack with each.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Because data channels were new and fancy in 2011 and backward compat was
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a concern this results in SDP (due to rules in RFC 8829) which puts the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel bits in the SDP after the audio and video bits (and in Safari
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the order of audio and video bits depend on the lexical ordering of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; random uuid of the MediaStreamTrack) so the SDP looks roughly like this:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   v=0 (6 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=audio 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 63 111 (23 more lines) direction=sendonly
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mid=0
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=video 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96 97 98 99 100 101 45 46 (63 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; direction=sendonly mid=1
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=application 9 UDP/DTLS/SCTP webrtc-datachannel (9 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; direction=sendrecv mid=2
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Which is ok but you are probably scratching your head why this order
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; does not match the order of calls (or why in Safari you get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video-audio-application half the time)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specifies this (search for &#38;quot;Lastly, &#38;quot;) but does not provide much of a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rationale. &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; has some 2016
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rationale.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now that seems like an odd choice but had little consequence until...

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appears to be a chrome-only bug report with a particular demo that doesn&#39;t
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; use the alwaysNegotiateDataChannels attribute and works on Firefox. I 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; don&#39;t
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; quite understand what the new configuration extension has to do with the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; original bug report.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebRTC added APIs that allow you to negotiate codecs at some point. This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; can result in a situation where you end up with a incompatible set of video
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; codecs (see the bug) and if those happen to be first in the SDP this &#38;quot;m=&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; line will be marked as &#38;quot;rejected&#38;quot; and can not be used to convey the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; transport information anymore.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; At best this results in another round of negotiation to satisfy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; actually provides a recommendation on how to avoid this: you pick
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; something that is &#38;quot;unlikely to be rejected by the remote side&#38;quot;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The browser does not have an API that would lead to it rejecting a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel m= line (which can happen for audio and video)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; So it would be great to pick this datachannel m= line as &#38;quot;offerer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; tagged&#38;quot; which avoids this headache.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But that requires (unless you want to risk more breakage) putting this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; m= line first which is conflicts with the rules of RFC 8829.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The alternative is going through at least two rounds of negotiation
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (which involves the remote end), the first datachannel only and then adding
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; media.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hence you need a way to opt-in which is the boolean in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RTCConfiguration.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would you like to hear more about why WebRTC is so weird? (a lot of this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; boils down to &#38;quot;SDP is not an opaque blob)

&#38;gt; Sorry, quick followup, keeping always in the name would make sense if it
&#38;gt; was explained that because this is negotiated first it ensures that we at
&#38;gt; least will always negotiate a data channel even if audio and video fail.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thank you for the explanation. I definitely agree that this sounds very
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; important. My concern remains that the parameter name and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developer documentation does not convey this and without this context it&#39;s
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; unclear why I should use this. As an example, the config parameter could
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; just be called negotiateDataChannels, as a cue that this will ensure your
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; connection is configured to support creating data channels. It would be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; worth also explaining why you want to do this, with a short snippet showing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; how a data channel can be added later.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The spec says that it is negotiated before audio or video but doesn&#39;t
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; explain why you might want to do this - i.e. to ensure that you can
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiate a connection even if the audio or video channels fail to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiate a compatible codec.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; TLDR; I&#39;m not opposed to this feature - after learning what it does and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; why, I agree we need it. I just think it would be very hard for someone
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; reading about this to understand that they should use it to resolve these
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issues.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This simple API plugs a missing piece of functionality: there is no way
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to tell WebRTC that you may want to use data channels at some point in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; future without having to re-negotiate, so the only way to ensure you
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiate data channels unconditionally is to create these dummy data
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; channels not to be intended for use that you have to manually ignore at the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; other endpoint, both with regards to events firing and when parsing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; statistics.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Creating dummy data channels is a workaround to a mistake in the API in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; my opinion, and I would support it even if all that it achieved was API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ergonomics.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But it does achieve something more than the workaround is able to:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; placing the m= application line at the top. The fact that the order of m=
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sections is more predictable reduces the risk of application bugs. I
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; believe Google Meet had a serious regression a few years ago where the m=
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; section order was something not what we expected causing the SDP parser to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fail and the call to be disconnected. It&#39;s also a good idea that the m=
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application line gets tagged, avoiding risk of rejecting the whole bundle
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if the wrong m= section is rejected.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The specification just says &#38;quot;alwaysNegotiateDataChannels defines a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; way for the application to negotiate data channels in the SDP offer 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; before
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; creating a datachannel&#38;quot;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;m finding it a bit hard to reason about what this means for me as a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developer. I.e. when should I set it and how does this change the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; connection?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Lets say you create a RTCPeerConnection. Create an offer and call
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; setLocalDescription. Send it to your peer. You get an answer from the peer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and feed it into setRemoteDescription.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You might wonder why it does not result in a connection.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Next, you create a datachannel. Your datachannel never opens because
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; after adding the datachannel (only the first!) you need to call
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; createOffer/setLocalDescription and call setRemoteDescription with the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; answer.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;web developers&#38;quot; are notably confused:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79737908/how-do-i-create-a-data-channel-in-webrtc-js-firefox-115-6-esr&#34;&#38;gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79737908/how-do-i-create-a-data-channel-in-webrtc-js-firefox-115-6-esr&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now your connection gets established. If you add another data channel
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you do *not* need to do this negotiation again (thankfully; adding audio or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video tracks requires negotiation).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In this case using the boolean flag is saving you one round of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In many applications you do not know if you want to use a datachannel
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but since you might, you preemptively create one and throw it away. You can
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; see that e.g. in Google Meet which calls
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    pc.createDataChannel(&#38;quot;ignored&#38;quot;, {reliable: true})
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It never uses that channel but it shows up in the getStats API every
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; time.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this mean that a data channel will be negotiated without calling
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; createDataChannel?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The underlying SCTP association will be negotiated and can be used by
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; subsequent calls to createDataChannel without renegotiation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This currently means exchanging four packets over the network (but that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; upfront cost might go away later this year).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Everything is set up to just work.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will that requested datachannel result in a datachannel event or does
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; my code still need to call createDataChannel? If the latter, is this a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; performance optimization?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Part of it is a performance / ergonomics optimization. But behold,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; there comes the 2011 backward compat angle below.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would I choose this when data is more important to connect first
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rather than e.g. voice / video?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Lets say you have a stream from getUserMedia with audio and video and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; would also like to have a datachannel.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You call pc.createDataChannel and then iterate over the MediaStream&#39;s
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; getTracks and call pc.addTrack with each.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Because data channels were new and fancy in 2011 and backward compat
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; was a concern this results in SDP (due to rules in RFC 8829) which puts the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel bits in the SDP after the audio and video bits (and in Safari
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the order of audio and video bits depend on the lexical ordering of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; random uuid of the MediaStreamTrack) so the SDP looks roughly like this:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   v=0 (6 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=audio 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 63 111 (23 more lines) direction=sendonly
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mid=0
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=video 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96 97 98 99 100 101 45 46 (63 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; direction=sendonly mid=1
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=application 9 UDP/DTLS/SCTP webrtc-datachannel (9 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; direction=sendrecv mid=2
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Which is ok but you are probably scratching your head why this order
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; does not match the order of calls (or why in Safari you get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video-audio-application half the time)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specifies this (search for &#38;quot;Lastly, &#38;quot;) but does not provide much of a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rationale. &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; has some 2016
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rationale.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now that seems like an odd choice but had little consequence until...
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The linked tracking bug &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/433898678&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/433898678&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appears to be a chrome-only bug report with a particular demo that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; doesn&#39;t
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; use the alwaysNegotiateDataChannels attribute and works on Firefox. I 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; don&#39;t
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; quite understand what the new configuration extension has to do with the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; original bug report.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebRTC added APIs that allow you to negotiate codecs at some point.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This can result in a situation where you end up with a incompatible set of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video codecs (see the bug) and if those happen to be first in the SDP this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;m=&#38;quot; line will be marked as &#38;quot;rejected&#38;quot; and can not be used to convey the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; transport information anymore.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; At best this results in another round of negotiation to satisfy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; actually provides a recommendation on how to avoid this: you pick
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; something that is &#38;quot;unlikely to be rejected by the remote side&#38;quot;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The browser does not have an API that would lead to it rejecting a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel m= line (which can happen for audio and video)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; So it would be great to pick this datachannel m= line as &#38;quot;offerer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; tagged&#38;quot; which avoids this headache.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But that requires (unless you want to risk more breakage) putting this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; m= line first which is conflicts with the rules of RFC 8829.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The alternative is going through at least two rounds of negotiation
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (which involves the remote end), the first datachannel only and then adding
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; media.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hence you need a way to opt-in which is the boolean in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RTCConfiguration.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
It sounds like you&#39;re saying here that this may not be backwards compatible
and if the other end doesn&#39;t support it you may not be able to establish a
connection. If so, is it possible for the developer to feature detect
whether the browser supports this so that they may determine whether both
ends support this or not before setting it?

Would you like to hear more about why WebRTC is so weird? (a lot of this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; boils down to &#38;quot;SDP is not an opaque blob)

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hi Yoav --

Chrome web platform security folks took a quick look at this -- we think 
there aren&#39;t any concerns but I think the spec could be clarified a bit to 
make it more obviously the case :-)&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Section 6 flags that UAs SHOULD only expose the data after explicit user 
confirmation. We think this is also important irrespective of timing 
attacks. It also wasn&#39;t immediately clear to us that the data being passed 
is limited to the specific autofill fields/type 
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/autofill-event/#dom-autofillevent-autofillevent-type-eventinitdict-type&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/autofill-event/#dom-autofillevent-autofillevent-type-eventinitdict-type&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
 
initially requested (and thus confirmed by the user) and this *cannot* be 
changed by the page handling the autofill event -- i.e., that all that can 
happen is a refill for the same data the user already consented to share. 
Maybe this is just under-specified and UA-dependent? I think it would still 
be good to at least discuss in the Security/Privacy considerations section, 
even if it&#39;s non-normative. Additionally, given that requirement, the new 
&#38;quot;full-address&#38;quot; field name may have UX challenges to ensure that the user 
understands the full scope of what is being shared.

Cheers,
Chris

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; Autofill is a key feature of the web that reduces friction for millions of 
&#38;gt; users everyday. But getting autofill to work reliably with dynamic forms 
&#38;gt; across multiple implementations requires jumping through many hoops. This 
&#38;gt; feature adds an &#38;quot;autofill&#38;quot; event that would allow developers to modify 
&#38;gt; their forms to fit the autofilled data and let the browser know when they 
&#38;gt; have done so.

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Web Feature ID*
&#38;gt; Missing feature
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt; Autofill today relies on static forms, but address forms are dynamic, 
&#38;gt; almost by definition. Addresses around the world have different fields and 
&#38;gt; requirements, and developers have to reconcile that dynamic nature with 
&#38;gt; autofill&#39;s static nature. Some browser heuristics are simplifying that task 
&#38;gt; in some implementations, but dealing with that implementation-specific 
&#38;gt; complexity requires jumping through a bunch of hoops. This feature will 
&#38;gt; enable developers to be notified of autofill-filled values, modify the form 
&#38;gt; to match the filled data and let the browser know when that modification 
&#38;gt; happened, enabling the browser to refill the data in the adapted form.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hi folks, I&#39;m wanting to kick off another Origin Trial for focusgroup from 
146-149, now with the new version of the implementation, see Focusgroup 
(Explainer) | Open UI 
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://open-ui.org/components/scoped-focusgroup.explainer/&#34;&#38;gt;https://open-ui.org/components/scoped-focusgroup.explainer/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Let me know if I can get approval for an extension to that original 
experiment, if we need to make a new entry, or something else.
Thanks!
-Jacques

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Ongoing technical constraints 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Debuggability 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Dev tools error logging is supported for various invalid combinations of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; focusgroup values in HTML.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)? Yes 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Supported on all platforms but requires a keyboard with directional 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; arrows.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

question of &#39;window&#39; vs &#39;document&#39;. We haven&#39;t pushed this to consensus,
but Domenic&#39;s position will be influential, and my read of it argues to put
this on Window or WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope. The TAG did miss the question
of whether this would be useful to workers.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; show up in the original email, hmm...). This specific point was not raised
&#38;gt; by them, however I did address the renames they proposed. I understand
&#38;gt; there has been some discussion on `window` and namespacing in

&#38;gt; has not reached consensus. On that issue in particular, I tend to agree
&#38;gt; with Anne and Domenic&#39;s view though (against namespacing).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Actually, no. Possibly minor editorial things I need to wade through,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but otherwise no. I&#39;ll get on landing it.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I think it&#39;s probably fine not to block on WPT tests for landing this,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but if Mozilla is (as you say) likely to start working on an implementation
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; over the next year then I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;d prefer we explore the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feasibility of adding WPT infrastructure.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Right, this API is still a priority and staffed, so if such a signal
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comes in, getting all the WPT infrastructure worked out will become a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; priority and something we will lead, since the utility will be clear.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; DevTools integration seems like good follow up work - but given the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ephemeral (~session storage-like) nature of the storage, it seems easy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; enough to clear state as-is.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A new key-value API, tentatively `window.crashReport`, backed by a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; per-Document map holding data that gets appended to crash reports. See
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/15&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/15&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; for initial
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; discussion. The data placed in this API&#39;s backing map gets sent in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `CrashReportBody` [1] if any renderer process crashes are incurred by the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; site. This lets developers debug what specific state in their application
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; might be causing a given crash. [1]:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The Crash Reporting API (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; allows developers to know when their site is crashing in the wild, and get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; some very rudimentary information associated with each crash. But
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers don&#39;t have enough to go off to debug the crash further. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; allows
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers to get a JavaScript stack trace, but only for unresponsive
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crashes. Outside of this narrow case, developers have a hard time tying
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their specific logic or features to a real-world crash. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `window.crashReport` API exposes a light-weight key-value store that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers can use to store breadcrumbs of their app state, which get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appended to crash reports that get sent to their developer-specified
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; endpoints. This significantly helps developers pinpoint the cause of a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crash they&#39;re seeing in the wild, and radically speed up their debugging
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cycle.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature could benefit by DevTools integration, to help developers

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature is not fully testable with Web Platform Tests, because

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; processes. This limitation has not prevented the Crash Report
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Infrastructure from shipping in general, nor has it prevented additions
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; like &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;. This API will
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; be tested with as many web platform tests as possible to assert the shape
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and semantics of the JS-exposed web API.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; CrashReportingStorageAPI
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Rollout plan*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will ship enabled for all users
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Requires code in //chrome?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; False
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Tracking bug*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/issues/400432195&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/issues/400432195&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; My expectation is that the feature is available only in Chromium
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; browsers for at least 12 months, with a possible (seems likely)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation in Firefox to follow.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We expect the feature to be used by a very small number of large
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners with uniquely complicated, memory-intensive web applications, and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comprehensive client and server-side debugging infrastructure. These
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners will be using the API well within 12 months of launch in Chrome.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Estimated milestones*

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Anticipated spec changes*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re considering ergonomic additions to the API in the near future,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; such as: - The ability to retrieve keys placed in the crash storage - The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ability to reset the storage entirely (freeing it), and re-request a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; different amount later The API has been designed in a way that does not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; preclude any of these additions.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hey Chris!

On Mon, Jan 26, 2026 at 9:10 PM Chris Thompson &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a href=&#34;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&#34; class=&#34;__cf_email__&#34; data-cfemail=&#34;5231263a7c7c7c12353d3d353e377c313d3f&#34;&#38;gt;[email&#38;#160;protected]&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; wrote:&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; Hi Yoav --
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Chrome web platform security folks took a quick look at this -- we think
&#38;gt; there aren&#39;t any concerns but I think the spec could be clarified a bit to
&#38;gt; make it more obviously the case :-)
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Section 6 flags that UAs SHOULD only expose the data after explicit user
&#38;gt; confirmation. We think this is also important irrespective of timing
&#38;gt; attacks.
&#38;gt;

Yeah, the &#38;quot;timing attack&#38;quot; title is not appropriate. I&#39;ll revamp.


&#38;gt; It also wasn&#39;t immediately clear to us that the data being passed is
&#38;gt; limited to the specific autofill fields/type
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/autofill-event/#dom-autofillevent-autofillevent-type-eventinitdict-type&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/autofill-event/#dom-autofillevent-autofillevent-type-eventinitdict-type&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; initially requested (and thus confirmed by the user) and this *cannot* be
&#38;gt; changed by the page handling the autofill event -- i.e., that all that can
&#38;gt; happen is a refill for the same data the user already consented to share.
&#38;gt; Maybe this is just under-specified and UA-dependent?
&#38;gt;

It&#39;s indeed not specified (as it&#39;s not specified today), but at the same
time, the spec does define the &#38;quot;full-address&#38;quot; autocomplete value
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/autofill-event/#full-address&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/autofill-event/#full-address&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that enables the UA
to know ahead of time that it needs to get user consent for the entire
address information, not just the fields currently present in the form.

We heard feedback from some UAs that this would be required for them, while
others felt that getting user consent of the specific parts of the address
implies consent for the more generic parts.

The attribute will enable each UA to apply the policy it deems fit.

I think it would still be good to at least discuss in the Security/Privacy
&#38;gt; considerations section, even if it&#39;s non-normative.
&#38;gt;

Sure!


&#38;gt; Additionally, given that requirement, the new &#38;quot;full-address&#38;quot; field name
&#38;gt; may have UX challenges to ensure that the user understands the full scope
&#38;gt; of what is being shared.
&#38;gt;

Potentially, but I imagined it being equivalent to pretending that all the
fields that are relevant to the user&#39;s address are already present in the
form.


&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Cheers,

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Autofill is a key feature of the web that reduces friction for millions
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of users everyday. But getting autofill to work reliably with dynamic forms
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; across multiple implementations requires jumping through many hoops. This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature adds an &#38;quot;autofill&#38;quot; event that would allow developers to modify
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their forms to fit the autofilled data and let the browser know when they
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; have done so.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Web Feature ID*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Missing feature
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Autofill today relies on static forms, but address forms are dynamic,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; almost by definition. Addresses around the world have different fields and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; requirements, and developers have to reconcile that dynamic nature with
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; autofill&#39;s static nature. Some browser heuristics are simplifying that task
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in some implementations, but dealing with that implementation-specific
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; complexity requires jumping through a bunch of hoops. This feature will
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; enable developers to be notified of autofill-filled values, modify the form
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to match the filled data and let the browser know when that modification
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; happened, enabling the browser to refill the data in the adapted form.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;All, I&#39;ve an update on this Intent to Ship.

After enabling this change we have seen a regression in our test suite,
whereby Search stories on Android show an increase in memory usage. Not
crashes, but a regression nonetheless. I&#39;m trying to get to the bottom of
why. The test suite does use an Android device with 900MB of RAM (though
confusingly labelled as wembley_2GB!) meaning that with this change it
would now report 2GB of total device memory instead of the 1GB that would
have previously been used. I&#39;m guessing this triggers more features that
were previously disabled but am following up with Search to confirm as I
can&#39;t quite identify where that happens myself from the outside.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Anyway, the good news is that allowing back 1GB on Android seems to fix the
regression.

There&#39;s a good question as to whether that 900MB RAM is a good test device
nowadays, but it did make me have another look at this and upon reviewing
internal device usage stats again, I&#39;m going to tweak this change slightly
to continue to allow 1GB on Android. In hindsight removing it may have been
a little premature and not being able to differentiate between 2GB and
lower on mobile is maybe not ideal yet. Longer term Search may wish to
consider upping their lower limit for if/when we remove 1GB in the future.

Usage of 1GB Device Memory of non-mobile devices remains very low so I
don&#39;t want to enable that, but since we&#39;ve already accepted different
thresholds at the upper end, having similar at the lower end seems OK too.
I&#39;ll confirm this with privacy too.

The alternative is to accept the regression and/or upgrade our test devices
but I&#39;m comfortable with including 1GB on Android for now.

Let me know if you&#39;ve any concerns with this slightly tweaked approach. It
still represents a big overall privacy improvement.

Thanks,
Barry

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; It does re-open the question of how we can get the various WGs that have
&#38;gt; maintenance responsibility to occasionally revisit these lists. Perhaps
&#38;gt; something we should discuss with the TAG?

&#38;gt; It seems like a bit of a design footgun to have different thresholds
&#38;gt; across platforms, and we do see 16+GB Androids very commonly, so I&#39;m
&#38;gt; wondering if we can&#39;t use a unified list in the update?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; I&#39;m not averse to keeping them the same and this is something I brought up
&#38;gt; with the WebPerf WG when I discussed this as I too would have preferred not
&#38;gt; to have different limits.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; However, saying that, 16GB on Android still seems super rare from our own
&#38;gt; internal stats (unfortunately I don&#39;t have approval to share exact details)
&#38;gt; and 32GB even more so. Rarer in fact than some of the values I&#39;m proposing
&#38;gt; dropping here for privacy reasons. I&#39;ve also looked at this globally, and
&#38;gt; again that introduces more concerns for certain regions.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Then again, they may not be rarer than the 8GB was when the original API
&#38;gt; was added. And, as you point out, they are only likely to become more
&#38;gt; common.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; If you and the other API owners feel strongly about this, I can speak to
&#38;gt; Privacy about this (and they&#39;ll need to sign this off anyway) and/or seek
&#38;gt; permission to get stats to share. But my personal point of view is with the
&#38;gt; limits I&#39;ve recommended for now, despite the fact they differ between
&#38;gt; device type. Hopefully with the precedent being set here, and some of the
&#38;gt; spec work to make this easier to update in the future having been completed
&#38;gt; already, adding 16GB or above when the time is right won&#39;t be as big or a
&#38;gt; burden in the future.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; As you know, it has been an ongoing frustation of mine that these values
&#38;gt; (and those for networks in netinfo) are so outdated.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; I did wonder about netInfo when making this change, but personally I&#39;ve
&#38;gt; become convinced that the ECT buckets are not good and not worth updating.
&#38;gt; I think the RTT value is a better one (and in Chrome ECT is currently only
&#38;gt; based on RTT anyway since Downlink proved less reliable, so doesn&#39;t match
&#38;gt; the spec) and doesn&#39;t require updating. So my preference is to retire
&#38;gt; ECT and depend on RTT instead, perhaps with non-normative advice on how to
&#38;gt; group them into categories. But anyway, that&#39;s off topic.

&#38;gt; to me that the values could be untruncated, both retaining those smaller
&#38;gt; values and perhaps also going upwards beyond 32. What do you think?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Potentially, though I&#39;m not sure we have precedent for this? Or if that
&#38;gt; risks its own web compatibility concerns and risks (e.g. functionality that
&#38;gt; works differently, or not at all, depending on whether it&#39;s installed or
&#38;gt; not).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Can you explain the use case/value of knowing beyond below 2GB or beyond
&#38;gt; 32GB at this point? I&#39;m not sure I can see a pressing need based on my
&#38;gt; knowledge of how the API is used, and the limited value small numbers,
&#38;gt; outside of the current values, delivers.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Also whether you&#39;d also be looking for a more granular breakdown between
&#38;gt; the currently coarsened values (e.g. knowing if it&#39;s 24GB as opposed to
&#38;gt; 16GB that would currently be reported with this change). The latter would
&#38;gt; require a spec change though because although the capping is noted as
&#38;gt; independent the &#38;quot;power-of-two&#38;quot; levels is not. So any such change would need
&#38;gt; to be discussed with the Web Perf Working Group first of all by opening an
&#38;gt; issue on the spec repo: &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/device-memory/issues&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/device-memory/issues&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; Set a new set of possible values for the Device Memory API:
&#38;gt; - Android: 2, 4, 8
&#38;gt; - Others: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
&#38;gt; Replacing the old values of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 which have grown
&#38;gt; outdated.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; This will reduce the fingerprinting risks at the lower end since device
&#38;gt; capabilities have improved since these were set.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; It will also allow better usage and segmenting of high-end devices as
&#38;gt; requested by developers (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/device-memory/issues/50&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/device-memory/issues/50&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;).

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt; While this does not introduce a new API and the values were somewhat*
&#38;gt; non-standardised the current values have been around for some time for
&#38;gt; Chromium-based browsers (the only implementor at this time).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; * Note: the ambiguity has been cleared up in the spec to make it super
&#38;gt; clear the values are implementation-defined and so subject to change.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; As such , I foresee two risks here:
&#38;gt; - Some web apps have gated some features on &#38;lt; 2GB RAM and these devices
&#38;gt; will now start to report as the minimum 2GB RAM and so enable features the
&#38;gt; devices may not be capable of using.
&#38;gt; - Some webpages may have incorrectly coded to presume no value &#38;gt;8 will
&#38;gt; ever be reported.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The compatibility risk here however seems small, and the privacy risk of
&#38;gt; remaining as is is not small.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; However the feature has been gated behind a feature flag so, should the
&#38;gt; worst happen, we can revert to the original values.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Gecko*: No signal (
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/g/mozilla.dev.platform/c/cfydu35XdnY/m/3IqYn0oJAQAJ&#34;&#38;gt;https://groups.google.com/g/mozilla.dev.platform/c/cfydu35XdnY/m/3IqYn0oJAQAJ&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
&#38;gt;  Firefox
&#38;gt; didn&#39;t go as far as giving a negative signal AFAIK but have raised
&#38;gt; concerns. They have not blocked updating these limits.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *WebKit*: Negative (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/device-memory/issues/24&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/device-memory/issues/24&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) Webkit
&#38;gt; are negative to the original API but have not blocked updating these limits.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Web developers*: Positive (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/device-memory/issues/50&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/device-memory/issues/50&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; ) Proposal
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Other signals*: This was discussed in the WebPerf WG group on 2026-01-15
&#38;gt; and we were in agreement to change this.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Ergonomics*
&#38;gt; Very low-end devices may no longer be excluded from features web
&#38;gt; developers have previously restricted to &#38;gt;= 2GB RAM.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Activation*
&#38;gt; None, other than those noted in Interoperability and compatibility risks.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt; Internal stats were reviewed to confirm the lower bounds are rarely used
&#38;gt; and so present a privacy risk.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; This was also confirmed with discussions with external RUM providers.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Additionally the new upper bounds were decided upon based on similar data
&#38;gt; review (internal only, since these values are not currently exposed—which
&#38;gt; is what we are trying to fix).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Finally, the upper bounds are not planned to be increased (yet) on Android
&#38;gt; since &#38;gt;8GB RAM is still rare for mobile devices.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&#38;gt; Kill switch (kUpdatedDeviceMemoryLimitsFor2026) included.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt; The feature is available from standard APIs, but it is not currently
&#38;gt; possible to emulate the values (since that will only change the reported
&#38;gt; value and not the amount of RAM used so is of limited use).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&#38;gt; Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt; Note different values on Android and other platforms
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;?*

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; These tests will be updated as part of this change (
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium-review.git.corp.google.com/c/chromium/src/+/7410045&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium-review.git.corp.google.com/c/chromium/src/+/7410045&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;).

&#38;gt; *No information provided*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Finch feature name*
&#38;gt; kUpdatedDeviceMemoryLimitsFor2026
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Non-finch justification*
&#38;gt; I am not planning on rolling this out via finch giving the low risk, but
&#38;gt; will include a feature flag (`kUpdatedDeviceMemoryLimitsFor2026`) to allow
&#38;gt; it to be turned off if the worst should happen.
&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; False

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt; Feature is available only in Chromium browsers for the foreseeable future.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt; RUM Providers using this feature can validate increased usefulness of the
&#38;gt; new values.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Adoption plan*
&#38;gt; Present at RUM CG on the change and ask for feedback after implementation.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&#38;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?
&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Estimated milestones*
&#38;gt; Shipping on desktop 146
&#38;gt; Shipping on Android 146
&#38;gt; Shipping on WebView 146
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Anticipated spec changes*

&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Window or WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope is right for this, IMO. I think
WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope would be better, but right now the Crash
Reporting infrastructure (beyond this API) only considers documents /
RenderFrameHosts, and does not apply to Workers. I think this is a legacy
artifact of how Crash Reporting was implemented a while back (it seems old;
I&#39;ve only recently added to it). I can envision implementation and spec
changes in the future to cover Workers, in which case we could move the API
to Window*OrWorkerGlobalScope* with little pain, but since the overall
infra is not implemented for workers, putting the crashReport API there
doesn&#39;t quite work at the moment.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; by them, however I did address the renames they proposed. I understand
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; there has been some discussion on `window` and namespacing in

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Right, this API is still a priority and staffed, so if such a signal
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comes in, getting all the WPT infrastructure worked out will become a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; priority and something we will lead, since the utility will be clear.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; enough to clear state as-is.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A new key-value API, tentatively `window.crashReport`, backed by a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; per-Document map holding data that gets appended to crash reports. See
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/15&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/15&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; for initial
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; discussion. The data placed in this API&#39;s backing map gets sent in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `CrashReportBody` [1] if any renderer process crashes are incurred by the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; site. This lets developers debug what specific state in their application
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; might be causing a given crash. [1]:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The Crash Reporting API (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; allows developers to know when their site is crashing in the wild, and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; some very rudimentary information associated with each crash. But
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers don&#39;t have enough to go off to debug the crash further. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; allows
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers to get a JavaScript stack trace, but only for unresponsive
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crashes. Outside of this narrow case, developers have a hard time tying
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their specific logic or features to a real-world crash. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `window.crashReport` API exposes a light-weight key-value store that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers can use to store breadcrumbs of their app state, which get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appended to crash reports that get sent to their developer-specified
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; endpoints. This significantly helps developers pinpoint the cause of a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crash they&#39;re seeing in the wild, and radically speed up their debugging
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cycle.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; consideration, but Mozilla is positive on the overall Crash Reporting

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; received positive, informal feedback in Web Perf WG when presenting this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and asking Firefox engineers for feedback.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebKit*: Negative (

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; concerns are not specific to this sub-API; they are concerned about the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; overall crash reporting infrastructure.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; excited to be able associate specific app state &#38;amp; data with web-exposed

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *No information provided*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature could benefit by DevTools integration, to help
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers more ergonomically interact with data in the crash report
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; storage. We&#39;re considering this integration as a follow-up to support our
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners, in the first half of 2026.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature is not fully testable with Web Platform Tests, because
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WPT infrastructure does not provide the ability to crash specific 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; renderer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; processes. This limitation has not prevented the Crash Report
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Infrastructure from shipping in general, nor has it prevented additions
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; like &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;. This API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will be tested with as many web platform tests as possible to assert the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; shape and semantics of the JS-exposed web API.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; My expectation is that the feature is available only in Chromium
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; browsers for at least 12 months, with a possible (seems likely)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation in Firefox to follow.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We expect the feature to be used by a very small number of large
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners with uniquely complicated, memory-intensive web applications, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comprehensive client and server-side debugging infrastructure. These
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners will be using the API well within 12 months of launch in Chrome.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; or interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issues in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re considering ergonomic additions to the API in the near future,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; such as: - The ability to retrieve keys placed in the crash storage - The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ability to reset the storage entirely (freeing it), and re-request a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; different amount later The API has been designed in a way that does not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; preclude any of these additions.

Summary
Chrome 142 restricted the ability to make requests to the user&#39;s local network, 
gated behind a permission prompt. A local network request is any request from a 
public website to a local IP address or loopback, or from a local website (for 
example, intranet) to loopback. Gating the ability for websites to perform 
these requests behind a permission mitigates the risk of cross-site request 
forgery attacks against local network devices such as routers, and reduces the 
ability of sites to use these requests to fingerprint the user&#39;s local network. 
This permission is restricted to secure contexts. If granted, the permissions 
additionally relaxes mixed content blocking for local network requests (since 
many local devices are not able to obtain publicly trusted TLS certificates for 
various reasons). This work supersedes a prior effort called [Private Network 
Access](&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5737414355058688&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5737414355058688&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;), which used 
preflight requests to have local devices opt-in. For more information on this 
feature, see [Adapting your website for new Local Network Access restrictions 
in 
Chrome](&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQkqehw8umtAgz5z0um7THx-aoU251p705FbIQjDuGs/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&#38;gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQkqehw8umtAgz5z0um7THx-aoU251p705FbIQjDuGs/edit?usp=sharing&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;).
 &#38;lt;br&#38;gt; Chrome 145 introduces more granular permissions for websites requesting 
access to a user&#39;s local network. The previous single `local-network-access 
permission` is being split into two distinct permissions: * `local-network`: 
Grants access to IP addresses in the local network space (for example, 
intranets, internal devices). * `loopback-network`: Grants access to loopback 
IP addresses (for example., `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`). The old `local-network` 
permission will remain as an alias, ensuring existing configurations and 
Permissions Policies continue to function as expected. This change provides 
both users and Admins with more precise control over how websites interact with 
internal network resources. Current enterprise policies managing local network 
access will not be affected by this change.

Risks




Interoperability and Compatibility
Interoperability risks: LNA requires a Secure Context to make local network 
requests, but exempts some of these local network requests from mixed content 
checks (if the user grants permission). If another browser does not implement 
LNA, these same local network requests might be blocked as mixed content, or 
the site might need to serve over HTTPS for Chrome and over HTTP for browsers 
that don&#39;t implement LNA (to avoid triggering mixed content). Compatibility 
risks: There are some local network requests types that we cannot know ahead of 
time will be going to the local network (eg, a subresource request to 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://test.example&#34;&#38;gt;http://test.example&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; which then resolves to 192.168.0.1). These would be blocked 
as mixed content, as mixed content checks happen before hostname resolution 
(ie, they occur before &#38;quot;Obtain a connection&#38;quot; in Fetch). Explicit local IP 
addresses, `.local` domains, and fetch() requests with the new 
`targetAddressSpace` fetch() option are exempted from mixed content checks, but 
other connection types may be difficult for developers (eg, WebSockets 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access/issues/16&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access/issues/16&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;). We 
hope that our Dev Trial will help identify compatibility issues. When we fully 
ship we also plan on running a reverse origin trial to allow sites to 
(temporarily) opt-out of the secure contexts requirement -- this would be an 
escape hatch for mixed content.

 Firefox is prototyping based on our spec draft. Request for signals: 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1260&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1260&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

WebKit: No signal Request for signals: 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/520&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/520&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

Web developers: Mixed signals 
(&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access/issues&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access/issues&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) 
Feedback from developers has been mixed, both due the new burden of a 
permission prompt (compared to PNA) and from some of the difficulty of 
navigating mixed content (the same as PNA). Many developers understand the 
reasoning behind adding the new permission though, and are productively 
engaging on how they can avoid issues.

Other signals: Brave ships a &#38;quot;localhost access&#38;quot; permission (see 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://brave.com/privacy-updates/27-localhost-permission/&#34;&#38;gt;https://brave.com/privacy-updates/27-localhost-permission/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)


Ergonomics
N/A


Activation
A new permission will be shown to users, which may be unexpected, and if users 
deny the permission functionality may break (potentially requiring additional 
support from site owners). Part of our goal for having a Dev Trial is to give 
site owners time to adjust their requests (especially if they need to use the 
mixed content exemptions) and to potentially adapt their UX flows so the 
permission requests are less surprising to users.


Security
Exempting some requests from mixed content checks based on declared 
targetAddressSpace could potentially be used to arbitrarily bypass mixed 
content. To avoid this, LNA does an additional check that the actual resolved 
address space matches what was declared, and blocks the request if it does not.


WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
No information provided



Goals for experimentation
No information provided


Reason this experiment is being extended
Launch of Local Network Access restrictions for WebSockets has been delayed 
from M144 to M147 due to holidays and enterprise concerns. We&#39;d like to push 
back the end date of this origin trial to allow for those running WebSockets on 
HTTP endpoints currently to opt out of the secure context restrictions for a 
period of time while they migrate to a secure context


Ongoing technical constraints
None


Debuggability
When a request would be blocked under LNA, we add a new DevTools Issue with 
details.


Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
No
Android WebView currently doesn&#39;t support letting apps grant any new permission 
types, so the Local Network Access permission is currently unconditionally 
granted in WebView. Android is separately adding a Local Network permission 
which would apply to the app that embeds a WebView

Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?
No

work-in-progress. &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wpt.fyi/results/fetch/local-network-access&#34;&#38;gt;https://wpt.fyi/results/fetch/local-network-access&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

Can you expand on how developers are supposed to use this? Would they need 
to add particular attributes that would let the browser know that the 
modules preloaded are CSS/JSON?
Is there a way for developers to detect browser support for this? What 
happens if there isn&#39;t? Is there a risk of preloading modules that would 
then not be used? 



*Specification*
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11981&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11981&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

*Summary*
Adds support for JSON and style module types as &#38;lt;link rel=&#38;quot;modulepreload&#38;quot;&#38;gt; 
destinations. &#38;lt;link rel=&#38;quot;modulepreload&#38;quot;&#38;gt; is already supported in Chromium 
(see &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5762805915451392&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5762805915451392&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;), but it currently 
only supports preloading script-like module scripts. This feature addresses 
a functionality gap, as JSON and CSS module scripts are supported in 
Chromium elsewhere but are not supported as &#38;lt;link rel=&#38;quot;modulepreload&#38;quot;&#38;gt; 
destinations. 


*Blink component*
Blink&#38;gt;DOM 
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1222907:%22Blink%3EDOM%22&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1222907:%22Blink%3EDOM%22&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

*Web Feature ID*
modulepreload &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://webstatus.dev/features/modulepreload&#34;&#38;gt;https://webstatus.dev/features/modulepreload&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

*Motivation*
Style and JSON are fully supported as modules in Chromium (see 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; and

rel=modulepreload&#38;gt; only supports preloading script modules. This feature 
addresses a gap in the platform. In addition, supporting &#38;quot;style&#38;quot; as a 
modulepreload destination addresses a pain point identified when using 
external files with Declarative CSS Modules (see &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

*Web developers*: No signals

*Other signals*:

*Ergonomics*
This feature will increase ergonomics with CSS Module Scripts (see 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) and Declarative CSS 
Module Scripts (see &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4790543041298432&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4790543041298432&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;). No 
known ergonomics risks.

*Activation*
No polyfill is necessary, as a module import will succeed regardless of 
whether it&#39;s preloaded or not. In unsupported browsers, it will do nothing.

*Security*
No security risks.

*WebView application risks*

*Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that 
it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?*
*No information provided*


*Debuggability*
Basic support via the Network tab in DevTools, which displays preloaded 
resources from this feature.

*Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, 
Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
Yes

*Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests 
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;?*

*Flag name on about://flags*
*No information provided*

*Finch feature name*
ModulePreloadStyleJson

*Non-finch justification*
This is not a new feature, just an expansion of an existing feature, so 
Finch is not necessary.

Per &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

change behind a feature flag, in case things go unexpectedly wrong. Can you 
do that?


*Rollout plan*
Will ship enabled for all users

*Requires code in //chrome?*
False

*Tracking bug*
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/issues/466888680&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/issues/466888680&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

*Measurement*
There is already a UseCounter for &#38;lt;link type=modulepreload&#38;gt; (see 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/2232&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/2232&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;). I plan 
on adding an additional UseCounter for style module preloads.

*Estimated milestones*
Shipping on desktop
146
Shipping on Android
146
Shipping on WebView
146


*Anticipated spec changes*

*Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or 
interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues 
in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may 
introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of 
the API in a non-backward-compatible way).*

&#38;gt; Window or WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope is right for this, IMO. I think 
&#38;gt; WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope would be better, but right now the Crash 
&#38;gt; Reporting infrastructure (beyond this API) only considers documents / 
&#38;gt; RenderFrameHosts, and does not apply to Workers. I think this is a legacy 
&#38;gt; artifact of how Crash Reporting was implemented a while back (it seems old; 
&#38;gt; I&#39;ve only recently added to it). I can envision implementation and spec 
&#38;gt; changes in the future to cover Workers, in which case we could move the API 
&#38;gt; to Window*OrWorkerGlobalScope* with little pain, but since the overall 
&#38;gt; infra is not implemented for workers, putting the crashReport API there 
&#38;gt; doesn&#39;t quite work at the moment.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; has not reached consensus. On that issue in particular, I tend to agree 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with Anne and Domenic&#39;s view though (against namespacing).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Actually, no. Possibly minor editorial things I need to wade through, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but otherwise no. I&#39;ll get on landing it.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I think it&#39;s probably fine not to block on WPT tests for landing this,

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; over the next year then I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;d prefer we explore the

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Right, this API is still a priority and staffed, so if such a signal 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comes in, getting all the WPT infrastructure worked out will become a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; priority and something we will lead, since the utility will be clear.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; DevTools integration seems like good follow up work - but given the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ephemeral (~session storage-like) nature of the storage, it seems easy 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; enough to clear state as-is.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A new key-value API, tentatively `window.crashReport`, backed by a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; per-Document map holding data that gets appended to crash reports. See 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/15&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/15&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; for initial 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; discussion. The data placed in this API&#39;s backing map gets sent in the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `CrashReportBody` [1] if any renderer process crashes are incurred by 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; site. This lets developers debug what specific state in their 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; might be causing a given crash. [1]:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The Crash Reporting API (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; allows developers to know when their site is crashing in the wild, and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; get 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; some very rudimentary information associated with each crash. But 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers don&#39;t have enough to go off to debug the crash further. The 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; allows 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers to get a JavaScript stack trace, but only for unresponsive 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crashes. Outside of this narrow case, developers have a hard time tying 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their specific logic or features to a real-world crash. The 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `window.crashReport` API exposes a light-weight key-value store that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers can use to store breadcrumbs of their app state, which get 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appended to crash reports that get sent to their developer-specified 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; endpoints. This significantly helps developers pinpoint the cause of a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crash they&#39;re seeing in the wild, and radically speed up their 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; debugging 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cycle.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; applications? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *No information provided* 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature could benefit by DevTools integration, to help 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers more ergonomically interact with data in the crash report 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; storage. We&#39;re considering this integration as a follow-up to support 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; our 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners, in the first half of 2026. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature is not fully testable with Web Platform Tests, because 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WPT infrastructure does not provide the ability to crash specific 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; renderer 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; processes. This limitation has not prevented the Crash Report 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Infrastructure from shipping in general, nor has it prevented additions 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; like &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;. This API 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will be tested with as many web platform tests as possible to assert 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; shape and semantics of the JS-exposed web API.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; My expectation is that the feature is available only in Chromium 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; browsers for at least 12 months, with a possible (seems likely) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation in Firefox to follow.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We expect the feature to be used by a very small number of large 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners with uniquely complicated, memory-intensive web applications, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comprehensive client and server-side debugging infrastructure. These 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners will be using the API well within 12 months of launch in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; open source repository and its open-source dependencies to function? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; or interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issues in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; may 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; structure of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way). 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re considering ergonomic additions to the API in the near future, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; such as: - The ability to retrieve keys placed in the crash storage - 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ability to reset the storage entirely (freeing it), and re-request a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; different amount later The API has been designed in a way that does not 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; preclude any of these additions.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Window or WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope is right for this, IMO. I think
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope would be better, but right now the Crash
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Reporting infrastructure (beyond this API) only considers documents /
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RenderFrameHosts, and does not apply to Workers. I think this is a legacy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; artifact of how Crash Reporting was implemented a while back (it seems old;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;ve only recently added to it). I can envision implementation and spec
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; changes in the future to cover Workers, in which case we could move the API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to Window*OrWorkerGlobalScope* with little pain, but since the overall
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; infra is not implemented for workers, putting the crashReport API there
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; doesn&#39;t quite work at the moment.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; there has been some discussion on `window` and namespacing in

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; DevTools integration seems like good follow up work - but given the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ephemeral (~session storage-like) nature of the storage, it seems easy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; enough to clear state as-is.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A new key-value API, tentatively `window.crashReport`, backed by a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; per-Document map holding data that gets appended to crash reports. See
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/15&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/crash-reporting/issues/15&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; for initial
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; discussion. The data placed in this API&#39;s backing map gets sent in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `CrashReportBody` [1] if any renderer process crashes are incurred by 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; site. This lets developers debug what specific state in their 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; might be causing a given crash. [1]:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The Crash Reporting API (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; allows developers to know when their site is crashing in the wild, and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; some very rudimentary information associated with each crash. But
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers don&#39;t have enough to go off to debug the crash further. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; allows
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers to get a JavaScript stack trace, but only for unresponsive
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crashes. Outside of this narrow case, developers have a hard time tying
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their specific logic or features to a real-world crash. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `window.crashReport` API exposes a light-weight key-value store that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers can use to store breadcrumbs of their app state, which get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appended to crash reports that get sent to their developer-specified
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; endpoints. This significantly helps developers pinpoint the cause of a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crash they&#39;re seeing in the wild, and radically speed up their 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; debugging
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cycle.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; concerns are not specific to this sub-API; they are concerned about the

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature could benefit by DevTools integration, to help
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers more ergonomically interact with data in the crash report
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; storage. We&#39;re considering this integration as a follow-up to support 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; our
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners, in the first half of 2026.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature is not fully testable with Web Platform Tests, because
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WPT infrastructure does not provide the ability to crash specific 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; renderer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; processes. This limitation has not prevented the Crash Report
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Infrastructure from shipping in general, nor has it prevented additions
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; like &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;. This API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will be tested with as many web platform tests as possible to assert 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Requires code in //chrome?*

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; My expectation is that the feature is available only in Chromium
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; browsers for at least 12 months, with a possible (seems likely)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation in Firefox to follow.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We expect the feature to be used by a very small number of large
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners with uniquely complicated, memory-intensive web applications, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comprehensive client and server-side debugging infrastructure. These
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners will be using the API well within 12 months of launch in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; open source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Estimated milestones*

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; or interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issues in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; structure of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re considering ergonomic additions to the API in the near
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; future, such as: - The ability to retrieve keys placed in the crash 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; storage
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - The ability to reset the storage entirely (freeing it), and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; re-request a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; different amount later The API has been designed in a way that does not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; preclude any of these additions.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Let me be a bit more direct: it&#39;s a bad smell for us to be putting things 
on Window if we can avoid it. Are you willing to move this to `navigator`?&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Window or WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope is right for this, IMO. I think 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope would be better, but right now the Crash 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Reporting infrastructure (beyond this API) only considers documents / 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RenderFrameHosts, and does not apply to Workers. I think this is a legacy 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; artifact of how Crash Reporting was implemented a while back (it seems old; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;ve only recently added to it). I can envision implementation and spec 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; changes in the future to cover Workers, in which case we could move the API 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to Window*OrWorkerGlobalScope* with little pain, but since the overall 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; infra is not implemented for workers, putting the crashReport API there 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; doesn&#39;t quite work at the moment.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Right, this API is still a priority and staffed, so if such a signal 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comes in, getting all the WPT infrastructure worked out will become a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; priority and something we will lead, since the utility will be clear.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `CrashReportBody` [1] if any renderer process crashes are incurred by 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; site. This lets developers debug what specific state in their 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; might be causing a given crash. [1]:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The Crash Reporting API (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; allows developers to know when their site is crashing in the wild, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and get 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; some very rudimentary information associated with each crash. But 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers don&#39;t have enough to go off to debug the crash further. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; allows 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers to get a JavaScript stack trace, but only for unresponsive 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crashes. Outside of this narrow case, developers have a hard time 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; tying 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their specific logic or features to a real-world crash. The 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `window.crashReport` API exposes a light-weight key-value store that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers can use to store breadcrumbs of their app state, which get 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appended to crash reports that get sent to their developer-specified 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; endpoints. This significantly helps developers pinpoint the cause of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crash they&#39;re seeing in the wild, and radically speed up their 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; debugging 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cycle.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; concerns are not specific to this sub-API; they are concerned about

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature could benefit by DevTools integration, to help 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers more ergonomically interact with data in the crash report 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; storage. We&#39;re considering this integration as a follow-up to support 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; our 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners, in the first half of 2026.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature is not fully testable with Web Platform Tests, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; because WPT infrastructure does not provide the ability to crash 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specific 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; renderer processes. This limitation has not prevented the Crash

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will be tested with as many web platform tests as possible to assert

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; My expectation is that the feature is available only in Chromium 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; browsers for at least 12 months, with a possible (seems likely) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation in Firefox to follow.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We expect the feature to be used by a very small number of large 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners with uniquely complicated, memory-intensive web 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; applications, and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; comprehensive client and server-side debugging infrastructure. These 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners will be using the API well within 12 months of launch in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; open source repository and its open-source dependencies to function? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compat or interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; known 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; github issues in the project for the feature specification) whose 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolution may introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; naming 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; or structure of the API in a non-backward-compatible way). 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re considering ergonomic additions to the API in the near 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; future, such as: - The ability to retrieve keys placed in the crash 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; storage 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - The ability to reset the storage entirely (freeing it), and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; re-request a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; different amount later The API has been designed in a way that does 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; not 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; preclude any of these additions.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hey Chris,

There was some confusion this morning about this Intent in API OWNERS. A 
couple of things would be helpful to tease out (and apologies if they&#39;re 
obvious to you; they weren&#39;t to us):&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

 - This is being phrased as an extension, however it seems that the API 
shape is changing too (the new permission policy name). Ordinarily, we&#39;d 
just approve something like that because it would likely be a breaking 
change, but it sounds like care is being taken not to break OT users here. 
Why?
 - Is it correct to say that this is both a deprecation (of the local 
network connection behaviour) and a new feature (the new permissions)? If 
so, how do you suggest the API OWNERS think about what sort of risk we&#39;re 
taking on?
 - What&#39;s the tlimeline for removal/ship (depending on answer to the 
previous question)?

Best,

Alex

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; Chrome 142 restricted the ability to make requests to the user&#39;s local 
&#38;gt; network, gated behind a permission prompt. A local network request is any 
&#38;gt; request from a public website to a local IP address or loopback, or from a 
&#38;gt; local website (for example, intranet) to loopback. Gating the ability for 
&#38;gt; websites to perform these requests behind a permission mitigates the risk 
&#38;gt; of cross-site request forgery attacks against local network devices such as 
&#38;gt; routers, and reduces the ability of sites to use these requests to 
&#38;gt; fingerprint the user&#39;s local network. This permission is restricted to 
&#38;gt; secure contexts. If granted, the permissions additionally relaxes mixed 
&#38;gt; content blocking for local network requests (since many local devices are 
&#38;gt; not able to obtain publicly trusted TLS certificates for various reasons). 
&#38;gt; This work supersedes a prior effort called [Private Network Access](
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5737414355058688&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5737414355058688&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;), which used preflight 
&#38;gt; requests to have local devices opt-in. For more information on this 
&#38;gt; feature, see [Adapting your website for new Local Network Access 
&#38;gt; restrictions in Chrome](
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQkqehw8umtAgz5z0um7THx-aoU251p705FbIQjDuGs/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&#38;gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQkqehw8umtAgz5z0um7THx-aoU251p705FbIQjDuGs/edit?usp=sharing&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;).
&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;br&#38;gt; Chrome 145 introduces more granular permissions for websites 
&#38;gt; requesting access to a user&#39;s local network. The previous single 
&#38;gt; `local-network-access permission` is being split into two distinct 
&#38;gt; permissions: * `local-network`: Grants access to IP addresses in the local 
&#38;gt; network space (for example, intranets, internal devices). * 
&#38;gt; `loopback-network`: Grants access to loopback IP addresses (for example., 
&#38;gt; `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`). The old `local-network` permission will remain 
&#38;gt; as an alias, ensuring existing configurations and Permissions Policies 
&#38;gt; continue to function as expected. This change provides both users and 
&#38;gt; Admins with more precise control over how websites interact with internal 
&#38;gt; network resources. Current enterprise policies managing local network 
&#38;gt; access will not be affected by this change.

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt; Interoperability risks: LNA requires a Secure Context to make local 
&#38;gt; network requests, but exempts some of these local network requests from 
&#38;gt; mixed content checks (if the user grants permission). If another browser 
&#38;gt; does not implement LNA, these same local network requests might be blocked 
&#38;gt; as mixed content, or the site might need to serve over HTTPS for Chrome and 
&#38;gt; over HTTP for browsers that don&#39;t implement LNA (to avoid triggering mixed 
&#38;gt; content). Compatibility risks: There are some local network requests types 
&#38;gt; that we cannot know ahead of time will be going to the local network (e.g., 
&#38;gt; a subresource request to &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://test.example&#34;&#38;gt;http://test.example&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; which then resolves to 
&#38;gt; 192.168.0.1). These would be blocked as mixed content, as mixed content 
&#38;gt; checks happen before hostname resolution (i.e., they occur before &#38;quot;Obtain a 
&#38;gt; connection&#38;quot; in Fetch). Explicit local IP addresses, `.local` domains, and 
&#38;gt; fetch() requests with the new `targetAddressSpace` fetch() option are 
&#38;gt; exempted from mixed content checks, but other connection types may be 
&#38;gt; difficult for developers (e.g., WebSockets 
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access/issues/16&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access/issues/16&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;). 
&#38;gt; We hope that our Dev Trial will help identify compatibility issues. When we 
&#38;gt; fully ship we also plan on running a reverse origin trial to allow sites to 
&#38;gt; (temporarily) opt-out of the secure contexts requirement -- this would be 
&#38;gt; an escape hatch for mixed content. 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Gecko*: Under consideration (
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-platform/c/B8oN3ARp_j0/m/rWKXmnj4AAAJ&#34;&#38;gt;https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-platform/c/B8oN3ARp_j0/m/rWKXmnj4AAAJ&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Web developers*: Mixed signals (
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access/issues&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access/issues&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) 
&#38;gt; Feedback 
&#38;gt; from developers has been mixed, both due the new burden of a permission 
&#38;gt; prompt (compared to PNA) and from some of the difficulty of navigating 
&#38;gt; mixed content (the same as PNA). Many developers understand the reasoning 
&#38;gt; behind adding the new permission though, and are productively engaging on 
&#38;gt; how they can avoid issues.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Other signals*: Brave ships a &#38;quot;localhost access&#38;quot; permission (see 
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://brave.com/privacy-updates/27-localhost-permission/&#34;&#38;gt;https://brave.com/privacy-updates/27-localhost-permission/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Ergonomics*
&#38;gt; N/A
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Activation*
&#38;gt; A new permission will be shown to users, which may be unexpected, and if 
&#38;gt; users deny the permission functionality may break (potentially requiring 
&#38;gt; additional support from site owners). Part of our goal for having a Dev 
&#38;gt; Trial is to give site owners time to adjust their requests (especially if 
&#38;gt; they need to use the mixed content exemptions) and to potentially adapt 
&#38;gt; their UX flows so the permission requests are less surprising to users.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt; Exempting some requests from mixed content checks based on declared 
&#38;gt; targetAddressSpace could potentially be used to arbitrarily bypass mixed 
&#38;gt; content. To avoid this, LNA does an additional check that the actual 
&#38;gt; resolved address space matches what was declared, and blocks the request if 
&#38;gt; it does not.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that 
&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Goals for experimentation*

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Reason this experiment is being extended*
&#38;gt; Launch of Local Network Access restrictions for WebSockets has been 
&#38;gt; delayed from M144 to M147 due to holidays and enterprise concerns. We&#39;d 
&#38;gt; like to push back the end date of this origin trial to allow for those 
&#38;gt; running WebSockets on HTTP endpoints currently to opt out of the secure 
&#38;gt; context restrictions for a period of time while they migrate to a secure 
&#38;gt; context
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Ongoing technical constraints*
&#38;gt; None
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt; When a request would be blocked under LNA, we add a new DevTools Issue 
&#38;gt; with details. 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, 
&#38;gt; Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt; No 
&#38;gt; Android WebView currently doesn&#39;t support letting apps grant any new 
&#38;gt; permission types, so the Local Network Access permission is currently 
&#38;gt; unconditionally granted in WebView. Android is separately adding a Local 
&#38;gt; Network permission which would apply to the app that embeds a WebView

&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; No

Summary
Add the full-size-kana value to the text-transform property. This value 
transforms small Japanese kana characters to their full-size equivalents. It is 
typically used for ruby annotation text, where small kana may be rendered at 
font sizes too small for legibility.


Blink component
Blink&#38;gt;Layout


Web Feature ID
text-transform


Motivation
Japanese script uses both small and full-size variants of kana characters, and 
this difference carries semantic meaning. Ruby annotations are typically 
rendered at tiny font sizes. At these sizes, small kana characters become 
difficult to distinguish from their full-size equivalents. The full-size-kana 
value transforms small kana to their full-size equivalents, improving 
legibility while preserving the correct characters in the source markup. 
Without this property, authors must hardcode the transformed text directly in 
their HTML. This breaks search functionality (users searching for the correct 
spelling won&#39;t find the content) and degrades accessibility (screen readers 
will mispronounce the hardcoded text).

Web developers: Positive
WebView application risks
Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
Low. The change is to ship a new API.
Goals for experimentation
Test out the new design of the &#38;quot;focusgroup&#38;quot; attribute and get feedback from 
developers.

Ongoing technical constraints
None.
Debuggability
Dev tools error and warning logging is supported for various invalid 
combinations of focusgroup values in HTML.
Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
Yes
Supported on all platforms but requires a keyboard or other device with 
directional arrows.

    Summary

    The cookie deprecation labels are useful for developers to
    evaluate and optimize deployments of the Privacy Sandbox APIs, and
    we want to avoid disruption while we engage with the industry to
    gather feedback on an updated roadmap for these technologies.
    Therefore we are asking to extend the current set of labels

    three more milestones.

    Goals for experimentation

    Continued deployment and evaluation of Privacy Sandbox Ads APIs.


    Experimental timeline

    This feature was previously approved to run up until Chrome 138.


    We would like to extend this for Chrome 139 through 141, inclusive.


    Any risks when the experiment finishes?

    Minimal, the cookie deprecation labels are only available for a
    subset of users and must be requested. Embedded services that will
    need to detect third-party cookie availability in Chrome
    &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.google.com/cookies/prepare/detect&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.google.com/cookies/prepare/detect&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;after
    the experiment ends can utilize Storage Access Headers
    &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/privacycg/storage-access-headers&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/privacycg/storage-access-headers&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;instead of
    relying on these labels.


    As new clients are ineligible for the experiment, the percentage
    of clients that receive the labels will decay over time, and
    eventually the experiment will effectively expire naturally.


    Reason this experiment is being extended

    We have received feedback that these labels are useful for ad tech
    companies to evaluate and optimize the APIs, and we want to avoid
    disruption while we engage with the industry to gather feedback on
    an updated roadmap for these technologies.


    Ongoing technical constraints

    None


    Will this feature be supported on all five Blink platforms
    supported by Origin Trials (Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, and
    Android)?

    No, not supported on webview.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hi,

Thanks for the questions. Find below my responses:&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;


   - Question: As a non-CSS expert, can you help me better understand what 
   &#38;quot;applying that special-case becomes ambiguous and difficult to define 
   consistently&#38;quot;? Is this in terms of code that authors would write, or prose 
   for spec authors? An example would be helpful here.
      - Answer: The ambiguity is primarily around spec semantics. Gap 
      decorations extended the column-rule-* properties to accept value lists 
and 
      `repeat()` patterns. The previous rule (“if style is none/hidden, then 
      computed width is 0”) is straightforward for a single value, but with 
lists 
      and repeats you no longer have a clean, well-defined way of expressing 
this 
      behavior. For example, from the CSSWG discussion:
         - column-rule-style: solid dashed none;
         - column-rule-width: 1px 2px; 
      - This cycles to: “1px solid, 2px dashed, (1px) none, 2px solid, 1px 
      dashed, (2px) none …”. 
      - Setting the width to zero in this case depending on the style at 
      any point in the expansion isn’t well-defined.
      - Also, `repeat()` syntax is preserved at computed-value time, which 
      further prevents expanding lists and applying a clean index-based rule:
         - column-rule-style: repeat(2, solid none dashed);
         - column-rule-width: 1px 2px;
      - This would expand to: “1px (solid), 2px (none), 1px(dashed), 
      2px(solid), 1px(none), 2px (dashed) …” But computed values explicitly do 
      not perform this expansion, so any rule that depends on per-index 
alignment 
      between style and width cannot be spec&#39;d in a well-defined way.
   - Question: 2.37% of page views is a lot of page views. Why do we feel 
   confident that border-width needs backwards compat considerations for 
   getComputedStyle but column-rule-width and outline-width don&#39;t? Are you 
   saying that 2.37% of the use counters are coming from fingerprinting? I&#39;m 
   also not sure what it means for a scraper to trigger a UseCounter - can you 
   clarify? I&#39;ve typically thought of scraping as a server-side operation - 
   are these web extensions?
   - Why do we feel confident that border-width needs backwards compat 
      considerations for getComputedStyle and column-rule-width and 
outline-width 
      don’t?
         - `border-*-width` properties are more commonly used and are tied 
         to the box model, so changing what getComputedStyle() returns is more 
         likely to affect existing scripts that compute geometry or layout 
related 
         behavior. In contrast, outline-width and column-rule-width are less 
         commonly used and are only used for visual decoration so returning the 
         author-specified width rather than 0px should not affect the element’s 
         geometry, making user-visible regressions less likely.
      - On the 2.37%
         - The use counter added was scoped to trigger when the resolved 
         value gotten from getComputedStyle is called on an element where style 
is 
         none/hidden but width is non-zero. While 2.37% is high we believe the 
         traffic is dominated by:
            - Fingerprinting/Telemetry scripts that typically iterate over 
            every CSS property to build a unique “fingerprint” of the browser.
            - Generic serializers that read all styles to copy/paste or 
            inspect elements
         - The default for these properties is *-width: medium and *-style: 
         none. This is also a contributing factor to this high percentage. So 
even 
         if a site doesn’t explicitly set these values and is being scraped, by 
         virtue of the defaults, the counter will get hit.
         - On scrapers being server side
            - In recent times, we’ve seen scrapers be headless browser 
            automation like Puppeteer or Selenium or client-side scripts in 
real 
            browsers. They can execute Javascript and call getComputedStyle 
which in 
            this case would expect the counter to be hit.
            These tools often query hundreds of properties which signals 
            that a high query rate does not necessarily imply meaningful 
web-facing 
            dependence on the current behavior.
         - Also, we are not first movers in this case, Webkit and Gecko 
         have shipped this.

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; This proposal untangles ‘border-width’, ‘outline-width’, and 
&#38;gt; ‘column-rule-width’ from their corresponding ‘*-style’ properties. 
&#38;gt; Previously, if a ‘*-style’ property, such as ‘border-style’, was set to 
&#38;gt; ‘none’ or ‘hidden’, the computed ‘*-width’, such as ‘border-width’, would 
&#38;gt; resolve to ‘0px’, even if the width was explicitly set to ‘10px’. Following 
&#38;gt; a resolution in the CSSWG [1], the computed values of ‘border-width’, 
&#38;gt; ‘outline-width’, and ‘column-rule-width’ will now reflect their specified 
&#38;gt; values, regardless of the associated style property&#39;s value. Similarly, the 
&#38;gt; resolved values of ‘outline-width’, and ‘column-rule-width’ will now 
&#38;gt; reflect their specified values, regardless of the associated style 
&#38;gt; property&#39;s value. [1]:

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt; Today, CSS special-cases ‘border-*-width’, ‘outline-width’, and 
&#38;gt; ‘column-rule-width’ so that their computed value becomes ‘0px’ when the 
&#38;gt; corresponding ‘*-style’ is ‘none’ or ‘hidden’, even if the author specified 
&#38;gt; a nonzero width. With Gap Decorations extending ‘column-rule-*’ properties 
&#38;gt; to support lists/repeaters, applying that special-case becomes ambiguous 
&#38;gt; and difficult to define consistently. Having ‘*-width’ values independent 
&#38;gt; of ‘*-style’, provides an intuitive model for these properties and better 
&#38;gt; reflects the author-specified value. 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; As a non-CSS expert, can you help me better understand what &#38;quot;applying that 
&#38;gt; special-case becomes ambiguous and difficult to define consistently&#38;quot;? Is 
&#38;gt; this in terms of code that authors would write, or prose for spec authors? 
&#38;gt; An example would be helpful here.

&#38;gt; *Risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt; The interoperability risk is low as both Gecko and Webkit have already 
&#38;gt; implemented these changes. Compatibility risk is also low. The resolved 
&#38;gt; value for `border-width` via `getComputedStyle()` will remain 0px when 
&#38;gt; `border-style` is set to `none`/ `hidden`, maintaining backward 
&#38;gt; compatibility. For `outline-width` and `column-rule-width`, both computed 
&#38;gt; and resolved values will show the specified values, as these properties are 
&#38;gt; rarely queried and unlikely to impact existing content. To support the 
&#38;gt; claim, we collected UseCounter data measuring how often these values are 
&#38;gt; queried. The computed‑value counters for these properties are extremely low 
&#38;gt; (&#38;lt;0.0001%). The resolved‑value counters for ‘column-rule-width’ and 
&#38;gt; ‘outline-width’ show ~2.37% usage, which reflects calls to 
&#38;gt; ‘getComputedStyle()’ rather than observable rendering usage. Since 
&#38;gt; ‘getComputedStyle()’ is frequently queried by automated tooling (e.g. 
&#38;gt; scrapers and fingerprinting scripts) that do not depend on property 
&#38;gt; semantics, this usage does not indicate meaningful web‑facing reliance. As 
&#38;gt; a result, the compatibility risk remains low. 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; 2.37% of page views is a lot of page views. Why do we feel confident that 
&#38;gt; border-width needs backwards compat considerations for getComputedStyle but 
&#38;gt; column-rule-width and outline-width don&#39;t? Are you saying that 2.37% of the 
&#38;gt; use counters are coming from fingerprinting? I&#39;m also not sure what it 
&#38;gt; means for a scraper to trigger a UseCounter - can you clarify? I&#39;ve 
&#38;gt; typically thought of scraping as a server-side operation - are these web 
&#38;gt; extensions?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; thanks!

Summary
This feature adds an AudioContext.playbackStats attribute which returns an 
AudioPlaybackStats object. This object provides audio playback statistics such 
as average latency, minimum/maximum latency, underrun duration, and underrun 
count. This API allows web applications to monitor audio playout quality and 
detect glitches. Note: This feature was previously tracked as 
AudioContext.playoutStats. It has been renamed to AudioContext.playbackStats to 
align with the final Web Audio API specification. The old name is supported as 
a deprecated alias for backward compatibility.


Blink component
Blink&#38;gt;WebAudio


Web Feature ID
web-audio


Motivation
There is currently no way to detect whether WebAudio playout has glitches (gaps 
in the played audio, which typically happens due to underperformance in the 
audio pipeline). There is an existing way to measure the instantaneous playout 
latency using AudioContext.outputLatency, but no simple way to measure 
average/minimum/maximum latency over time. With this API, we want to propose a 
way to be able to measure the delay of that audio and the glitchiness of the 
audio.

WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
None.



Debuggability
Can be tested by creating an AudioContext and evaluating context.playoutStats 
in the console.


Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
Yes


Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?
Yes

Summary

We propose an extension to the Geolocation API that introduces a new
option, accuracyMode, to getCurrentPosition() and watchPosition(). This
change allows the browser to return either precise or approximate location
data based on the user&#39;s granular permission setting for the site. This
mechanism is designed to resolve the existing privacy/utility conflict by
honoring the user&#39;s intent to share a low-precision location.
Blink component

Blink&#38;gt;Geolocation

Motivation

The standard Geolocation API currently creates a poor privacy/utility
trade-off: many websites need only an approximate location (e.g., for local
weather or content localization) but receive high-precision data, posing a
significant privacy risk.

While the existing enableHighAccuracy option is intended to indicate the
application&#39;s preference for accuracy, it is only a non-binding hint and
does not provide a mechanism for the user agent (browser) to enforce a
specific, low-precision outcome.

To solve this, we propose the Approximate Geolocation. This extension
introduces a new option, accuracyMode, to getCurrentPosition() and
watchPosition() that provides an explicit mechanism for both site and user
control:

   1.

   It allows sites to explicitly request an approximate location.
   2.

   Crucially, it enables the browser to reduce precision when a site
   requests precise location but the user has only granted an &#38;quot;approximate&#38;quot;
   level of permission.


By introducing this new, privacy-preserving permission state, we aim to
enhance user control while satisfying the vast majority of website use
cases.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;A potentially silly question, due to my complete ignorance of WebRTC 
protocol negotiations:
If I&#39;m planning to use this new boolean, that means that I may or may not 
want to negotiate a data channel.
If the other side doesn&#39;t support the boolean, I need to create a dummy 
data channel. If it does, I don&#39;t need to create one.
But you&#39;re saying that I have no way of knowing up front if it&#39;s one or the 
other.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

So how would developers know if they need to create a dummy channel? Is 
there some response to this boolean that indicates support or lack-thereof? 
If so, presumably it&#39;s not too late to create the dummy channel at that 
point?

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; this boils down to WebRTCs notion that the &#38;quot;SDP&#38;quot; is a &#38;quot; blob&#38;quot;.  Which 
&#38;gt; makes the API look easy but from the amount of fighting over the plan-b 
&#38;gt; deprecation, &#38;quot;sdp munging&#38;quot; or even the question when inbound-rtp stats 
&#38;gt; appear, this is causing trouble since this &#38;quot;blob&#38;quot; controls a ton of 
&#38;gt; behavior.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Developers can parse the SDP, e.g. like 
&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://jsfiddle.net/fippo/kct3dy46/&#34;&#38;gt;https://jsfiddle.net/fippo/kct3dy46/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; which with the new option set should return [&#38;quot;application&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;video&#38;quot;] 
&#38;gt; instead of [&#38;quot;video&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;application&#38;quot;].
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The opt-in boolean avoids changing the default behavior so no surprises 
&#38;gt; unless you use it.
&#38;gt; If you opt in you also (implicitly) agree that you are ready to deal with 
&#38;gt; the feature not being supported.
&#38;gt; So the other end that is parsing and processing the SDP you generate is 
&#38;gt; today receiving
&#38;gt;   audio-video-data
&#38;gt; without the opt-in and you ensure it works with
&#38;gt;   data-audio-video
&#38;gt; but you will still need to support the old way.
&#38;gt; I am not worried about browsers where we deal with only two SDP parsers 
&#38;gt; and both are well written robust enough to deal with.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; cheers

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature is only needed by the endpoint that creates the initial 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; offer and decides the m= section order, i.e. the other endpoint - whether 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; they support this feature or not - will accept the m= section order that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; on offer. Once the order is decided, it is &#38;quot;locked in&#38;quot; by both endpoints, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; as per old SDP rules. So it should be cross-browser compatible and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; backwards-compatible, here&#39;s me setting SDP with m= application line first 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and the offer is accepted: &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://jsfiddle.net/henbos/oweu42yz/&#34;&#38;gt;https://jsfiddle.net/henbos/oweu42yz/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; As for if the browser that is creating this offer supports the feature, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you can feature detect by testing it on a throwaway RTCPeerConnection 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; object that you immediately close afterwards.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Throwaway peerconnections are an antipattern too ;-)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Since RTCConfiguration is not exposed on window one can not feature 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; detect upfront but one can call pc.getConfiguration() to see if this had an 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; effect after creating the connection and then adapt if necessary (i.e. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; create the not-quite-throwaway channel)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Not sure I would bother with feature detection, the other side should 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; support the resulting SDP both with the new behavior of datachannels being 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; first or the current behavior so opt-in should be fine with fallback to the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; current status quo.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; it was explained that because this is negotiated first it ensures that

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thank you for the explanation. I definitely agree that this sounds 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; very important. My concern remains that the parameter name and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developer documentation does not convey this and without this context 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; it&#39;s 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; unclear why I should use this. As an example, the config parameter 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; could 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; just be called negotiateDataChannels, as a cue that this will ensure 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; your 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; connection is configured to support creating data channels. It would be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; worth also explaining why you want to do this, with a short snippet 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; showing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; how a data channel can be added later.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Negotiating datachannels is already an overloaded term - the SDP 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiates support and datachannels themselves are negotiated in-band but 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; can also be negotiated out-of-band.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The spec says that it is negotiated before audio or video but 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; doesn&#39;t explain why you might want to do this - i.e. to ensure that you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; can 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiate a connection even if the audio or video channels fail to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiate a compatible codec.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; TLDR; I&#39;m not opposed to this feature - after learning what it does 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and why, I agree we need it. I just think it would be very hard for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; someone 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; reading about this to understand that they should use it to resolve 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; these 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issues.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The WebRTC samples &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/webrtc/samples&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/webrtc/samples&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; have always been 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; great for showing how a feature works but in this case even I have a hard 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; time coming up with a good sample.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adoption is more likely from opensource projects currently working 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; around this like MediaSoup and then it trickles down from there. Who knows, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; maybe Google Meet might drive adoption just to get rid of the &#38;quot;ignored&#38;quot; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel ;-)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This simple API plugs a missing piece of functionality: there is no 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; way to tell WebRTC that you may want to use data channels at some 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; point in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the future without having to re-negotiate, so the only way to ensure 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiate data channels unconditionally is to create these dummy data 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; channels not to be intended for use that you have to manually ignore 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; at the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; other endpoint, both with regards to events firing and when parsing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; statistics.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Creating dummy data channels is a workaround to a mistake in the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API in my opinion, and I would support it even if all that it achieved 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; was 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API ergonomics.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But it does achieve something more than the workaround is able to: 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; placing the m= application line at the top. The fact that the order of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; m= 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sections is more predictable reduces the risk of application bugs. I 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; believe Google Meet had a serious regression a few years ago where the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; m= 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; section order was something not what we expected causing the SDP 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; parser to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fail and the call to be disconnected. It&#39;s also a good idea that the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; m= 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application line gets tagged, avoiding risk of rejecting the whole 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; bundle 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if the wrong m= section is rejected.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; as a developer. I.e. when should I set it and how does this change 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; connection?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Lets say you create a RTCPeerConnection. Create an offer and call 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; setLocalDescription. Send it to your peer. You get an answer from the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; peer 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and feed it into setRemoteDescription.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You might wonder why it does not result in a connection.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Next, you create a datachannel. Your datachannel never opens 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; because after adding the datachannel (only the first!) you need to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; call 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; createOffer/setLocalDescription and call setRemoteDescription with

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now your connection gets established. If you add another data 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; channel you do *not* need to do this negotiation again (thankfully; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; adding 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; audio or video tracks requires negotiation).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In this case using the boolean flag is saving you one round of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In many applications you do not know if you want to use a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel but since you might, you preemptively create one and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; throw it 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; away. You can see that e.g. in Google Meet which calls
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    pc.createDataChannel(&#38;quot;ignored&#38;quot;, {reliable: true})
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It never uses that channel but it shows up in the getStats API 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; every time.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this mean that a data channel will be negotiated without 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; calling createDataChannel?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The underlying SCTP association will be negotiated and can be used 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; by subsequent calls to createDataChannel without renegotiation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This currently means exchanging four packets over the network (but 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that upfront cost might go away later this year).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Everything is set up to just work.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will that requested datachannel result in a datachannel event or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; does my code still need to call createDataChannel? If the latter, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is this a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; performance optimization? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Part of it is a performance / ergonomics optimization. But behold, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; there comes the 2011 backward compat angle below.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would I choose this when data is more important to connect first 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rather than e.g. voice / video?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Lets say you have a stream from getUserMedia with audio and video 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and would also like to have a datachannel.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You call pc.createDataChannel and then iterate over the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; MediaStream&#39;s getTracks and call pc.addTrack with each.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Because data channels were new and fancy in 2011 and backward 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compat was a concern this results in SDP (due to rules in RFC 8829) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; puts the datachannel bits in the SDP after the audio and video bits 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (and in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Safari the order of audio and video bits depend on the lexical 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ordering of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the random uuid of the MediaStreamTrack) so the SDP looks roughly 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; like this:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   v=0 (6 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=audio 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 63 111 (23 more lines) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; direction=sendonly mid=0
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=video 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96 97 98 99 100 101 45 46 (63 more 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lines) direction=sendonly mid=1
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=application 9 UDP/DTLS/SCTP webrtc-datachannel (9 more lines) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; direction=sendrecv mid=2
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Which is ok but you are probably scratching your head why this 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; order does not match the order of calls (or why in Safari you get 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video-audio-application half the time)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specifies this (search for &#38;quot;Lastly, &#38;quot;) but does not provide much of a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rationale. &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; has some 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 2016 rationale.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now that seems like an odd choice but had little consequence 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; until...
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appears to be a chrome-only bug report with a particular demo that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; doesn&#39;t

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I don&#39;t 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; quite understand what the new configuration extension has to do 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; original bug report.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebRTC added APIs that allow you to negotiate codecs at some 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; point. This can result in a situation where you end up with a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; incompatible 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; set of video codecs (see the bug) and if those happen to be first in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; SDP this &#38;quot;m=&#38;quot; line will be marked as &#38;quot;rejected&#38;quot; and can not be used 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; convey the transport information anymore.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; At best this results in another round of negotiation to satisfy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; actually provides a recommendation on how to avoid this: you pick 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; something that is &#38;quot;unlikely to be rejected by the remote side&#38;quot;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The browser does not have an API that would lead to it rejecting a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel m= line (which can happen for audio and video)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; So it would be great to pick this datachannel m= line as &#38;quot;offerer 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; tagged&#38;quot; which avoids this headache.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But that requires (unless you want to risk more breakage) putting 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this m= line first which is conflicts with the rules of RFC 8829.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The alternative is going through at least two rounds of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiation (which involves the remote end), the first datachannel 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; only and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; then adding media.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hence you need a way to opt-in which is the boolean in the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RTCConfiguration.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It sounds like you&#39;re saying here that this may not be backwards 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compatible and if the other end doesn&#39;t support it you may not be able to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; establish a connection. If so, is it possible for the developer to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; detect whether the browser supports this so that they may determine 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; whether 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; both ends support this or not before setting it?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would you like to hear more about why WebRTC is so weird? (a lot of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this boils down to &#38;quot;SDP is not an opaque blob)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adds support for JSON and style module types as &#38;lt;link 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rel=&#38;quot;modulepreload&#38;quot;&#38;gt; destinations. &#38;lt;link rel=&#38;quot;modulepreload&#38;quot;&#38;gt; is already 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; supported in Chromium (see 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5762805915451392&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5762805915451392&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;), but it currently 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; only supports preloading script-like module scripts. This feature addresses 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a functionality gap, as JSON and CSS module scripts are supported in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chromium elsewhere but are not supported as &#38;lt;link rel=&#38;quot;modulepreload&#38;quot;&#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; destinations.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Blink component*

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Style and JSON are fully supported as modules in Chromium (see 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5749863620804608&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5749863620804608&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;), but &#38;lt;link 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rel=modulepreload&#38;gt; only supports preloading script modules. This feature 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; addresses a gap in the platform. In addition, supporting &#38;quot;style&#38;quot; as a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; modulepreload destination addresses a pain point identified when using 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; external files with Declarative CSS Modules (see 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4790543041298432&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4790543041298432&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Ergonomics*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature will increase ergonomics with CSS Module Scripts (see 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) and Declarative CSS

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No known ergonomics risks.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Activation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No polyfill is necessary, as a module import will succeed regardless of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; whether it&#39;s preloaded or not. In unsupported browsers, it will do nothing.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No security risks.

Thanks for reviewing the intent, Alex.

Regarding unified behavior with RTCAudioSourceStats, I don&#39;t believe this 
API serves the same goal. WebAudio’s stats are centered specifically around 
audio stream quality, so I am unsure about achieving unified behavior 
across these different APIs.

As for getting similar stats from the &#38;lt;audio&#38;gt; element or WebRTC contexts, 
both HTMLAudioElement and WebRTC&#39;s audio systems are &#38;quot;push-based.&#38;quot; By 
design, they should not experience audio sample dropouts or glitches in the 
same way. The WebAudio (pull-based) playback stats are specifically 
designed to catch dropouts so developers can estimate the user&#39;s audio 
quality and experience.

Hopefully this answers your question!

Best,
Hongchan

Hey Hongchan,

This looks extremely useful!

I&#39;m a little surprised to see that the TAG didn&#39;t ask about alignment with 
other APIs in the space, e.g.:

    &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats&#34;&#38;gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

Will we get unified behaviour here? Will it be possible to get similar 
stats from an &#38;lt;audio&#38;gt; element or WebRTC contexts, e.g.?

Best,

Alex

*Specification*
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioPlaybackStats&#34;&#38;gt;https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioPlaybackStats&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; 

*Summary*
This feature adds an AudioContext.playbackStats attribute which returns an 
AudioPlaybackStats object. This object provides audio playback statistics 
such as average latency, minimum/maximum latency, underrun duration, and 
underrun count. This API allows web applications to monitor audio playout 
quality and detect glitches. Note: This feature was previously tracked as 
AudioContext.playoutStats. It has been renamed to 
AudioContext.playbackStats to align with the final Web Audio API 
specification. The old name is supported as a deprecated alias for backward 
compatibility.

*Motivation*
There is currently no way to detect whether WebAudio playout has glitches 
(gaps in the played audio, which typically happens due to underperformance 
in the audio pipeline). There is an existing way to measure the 
instantaneous playout latency using AudioContext.outputLatency, but no 
simple way to measure average/minimum/maximum latency over time. With this 
API, we want to propose a way to be able to measure the delay of that audio 
and the glitchiness of the audio.

A bit more details would be useful here.
Even reading 
through 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api?tab=readme-ov-file#precommit-handlers&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api?tab=readme-ov-file#precommit-handlers&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;, 
the role of post-commit handlers, nor how does one define them today is not 
clear.

I *think* I have a vague idea, so let me try to take a stab and let me know 
if I got it right.
Currently a developer that wants to add a post-commit handler (or simply a 
`handler` in the current API) to e.g. send analytics that a navigation has 
happened, can do that using
```
navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; {
   if (e.canIntercept) {
    const handler = sendAnalytics(e);
    e.intercept({ handler });
  }
});
```

When they want to do something pre-commit (e.g. cancel the navigation if 
the target URL doesn&#39;t lead to a cat video), they can do something like
```
navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; {
   if (e.canIntercept) {
    const precommitHandler = verifyCatVideo(controller);
    e.intercept({ precommitHandler });
  }
});
```
They can even add both.

But when developers today want to add a post-commit (or &#38;quot;regular&#38;quot;) handler 
as a result of some handler in the pre-commit, they have no way of doing 
that.

This proposal is to add an `addHandler` method to the precommit controller, 
that would enable to add such post-commit handlers.

Is that roughly accurate?

If so, what would be an example use-case of wanting to add a post-commit 
handler as a result of pre-commit logic? What information does the 
pre-commit handler have that a post-commit logic doesn&#39;t?

*Summary*
Currently when intercepting navigations with the `navigate` event, 
precommitHandlers and post-commit ordinary handlers are passed separately. 
This works well when there is only one or the other, but can be a bit 
clunky when the flow includes a precommitHandler that leads to a 
post-commit handler. This addition is a small ergonomic improvement that 
enables registering a post-commit handler while invoking a precommit 
handler.

Yes!

&#38;gt; If so, what would be an example use-case of wanting to add a post-commit 
&#38;gt; handler as a result of pre-commit logic? What information does the pre-commit 
&#38;gt; handler have that a post-commit logic doesn&#39;t?

Something like this, where the precommit handler performs some logic
to understand what to do with the request, and perhaps begins some
sort of shell, to be later populated by the handler:
```js
navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; {
  if (e.canIntercept) {
     e.intercept({
       async precommitHandler(controller) {
            if (should_redirect(e.destination.url)) [
                 e.redirect(new_url);
                 return;
            }
            else if (should_cancel(destination.url)) {
                throw new Error(&#38;quot;cancel this navigation&#38;quot;);
            }
            const contentPromise = fetchPageData();
            const shell = await fetchPageShell();

            shell.show_skeleton();

            controller.addHandler(() =&#38;gt; show_actual_data(await contentPromise));
       }
  }
});
```

Doing it this way is slightly more ergonomic than managing promises
outside of the intercept call.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This has some risk of being a breaking change, right? How would
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you characterize that risk? Firefox having this is obviously a good sign,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but any other data or arguments on the risk? I imagine SVG use is fairly
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rare, and any selector mismatch would most likely be a minor formatting
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issue, right?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; That, or some display:none rule that didn&#39;t work before, starts working
&#38;gt; now, which could be a major or minor issue.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; An instantiated subtree will no longer be able to do selector matching
&#38;gt; against the surrounding elements from where it was instantiated from.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; In the following case, the use instance of the rect would no longer be red:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;!DOCTYPE html&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;style&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;   .original rect { fill: red; }
&#38;gt;   rect { fill: green; }
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;/style&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;svg&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;defs class=&#38;quot;original&#38;quot;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;     &#38;lt;rect id=&#38;quot;r&#38;quot; x=&#38;quot;0&#38;quot; y=&#38;quot;0&#38;quot; width=&#38;quot;100&#38;quot; height=&#38;quot;100&#38;quot; /&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;/defs&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;use href=&#38;quot;#r&#38;quot;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/use&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;/svg&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; I think this is unlikely to break real sites.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; I spent some time poking through the Firefox bug and its various
&#38;gt; associated bugs. I think it&#39;s a pretty good sign that this landed 8 years
&#38;gt; ago and the reported regressions were due to implementation bugs that were
&#38;gt; quickly fixed.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The absence of bugs in Bugzilla isn&#39;t a perfect compat signal, but it&#39;s at
&#38;gt; least promising.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; In order to use-count this, we would have to run both ways of cascading
&#38;gt; (or at least selector matching) to detect such cases.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; This sounds like a lot of complexity (but feel free to respond telling me
&#38;gt; it&#39;s trivial to implement). So, LGTM2 and hopefully I&#39;m not wrong about the
&#38;gt; risk here.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The main benefit from this change, I think, is that it fixes

&#38;gt; matching which is currently broken in &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instances.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The WebKit standards position was only filed yesterday, but this seems

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Align the Blink implementation with the SVG2 specification for matching
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; CSS rules in &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; element trees.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Match selectors against the &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instantiation elements instead of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; originating element subtree. This means selectors will no longer match
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ancestor and sibling elements outside the cloned subtree. More importantly,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; state selectors like :hover will now start matching in &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instances.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; CSS selectors match against the wrong tree for &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instantiations,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which means selectors do not match correctly for structural relationships

Summary
WebXR Layers offers a more efficient way of drawing immersive content. In 
addition to support for native color and depth textures and texture arrays, it 
also provides support for different layer types that are managed by the system 
compositor (as opposed to javascript).


Blink component
Blink&#38;gt;WebXR


Web Feature ID
webxr-layers


Motivation
Performance: Layers are presented at the frame rate of the compositor but can 
be updated at a lower rate in the browser. The compositor can reproject layers 
at high refresh while the browser just needs to draw pixels when they need to 
change (instead of when the user moves) Legibility / visual fidelity: In a 
typical WebXR session, the pixels are resampled twice. This greatly affects 
text legibility by drawing into a layers, resampling only happens once. Power 
consumption / battery life: Because the browser only has to render the pixels 
that changed and can rely on the compositor to draw cubemaps and equirects, far 
less javascript and gl commands need to run in the browser which increases the 
system&#39;s battery life. Latency: Since the compositor always has the latest pose 
data and runs at very high system priority, the scene will “stick” to the right 
location which improves the experience and lowers user fatigue. A good example 
where this all comes to gether is 360 videos. With regular WebXR, a large 
framework and very careful coding is needed to do the reprojection. Typically, 
the resolution and framerates of the video is lowered so the experience can fit 
in the cpu/memory budget of the device. The efficiency gains of layers should 
enable such video to reach parity quality with what is possible in native apps 
on XR devices. Additionally it significantly reduces the amount of

Risks




Interoperability and Compatibility
The spec is based upon the feature set of OpenXR with wide consensus/support 
across devices &#38;amp; operating systems. As long as the platform supports this 
standard (or something close to it), it should be possible to implement.

Web developers: Positive Positive initial response (privately) from multiple 
popular XR video framework developers.

Other signals:


Ergonomics
The WebXR layers API is extending the WebXR feature set. Its primary use case 
is improved performance and rendering quality. Today, authors have to rely on 
large frameworks to render high quality 360 or 180 video and they have to be 
very careful to not overload the system. With layers, this is now natively 
supported by the browser and since the compositor will do a lot of the heavy 
lifting, the load on the browser is significantly lower. We expect this API to 
improve developer ergonomics in WebXR.


Activation
Not all user agents will have immediate support for this feature. To mitigate 
this, we are planning on creating a polyfill.


Security
This spec leans heavily on WebXR existing security mitigations. The spec calls 
out some additional rules.


WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
No information provided



Debuggability
WebXR Layers are debugged in the same fashion as regular WebXR.


Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
No
The feature performs best if the platform has native support for layers which 
can be done through OpenXR or some other native API. We expect that most 
implementations will take that path. It might be possible to build a compositor 
into Chrome itself as a fallback.


Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?
Yes

Anticipated spec changes

Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or interop 
issues. Please list open issues (eg links to known github issues in the project 
for the feature specification) whose resolution may introduce web 
compat/interop risk (eg, changing to naming or structure of the API in a 
non-backward-compatible way).

&#38;gt; Any feedback from the OT?

The current partner mentioned that &#38;quot;The metrics collected from are
continuously used for the experimentation, we would not be able to verify
the quality without them.&#38;quot;

Hopefully this answers your question!

&#38;gt; Thanks for reviewing the intent, Alex.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Regarding unified behavior with RTCAudioSourceStats, I don&#39;t believe this
&#38;gt; API serves the same goal. WebAudio’s stats are centered specifically around
&#38;gt; audio stream quality, so I am unsure about achieving unified behavior
&#38;gt; across these different APIs.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; As for getting similar stats from the &#38;lt;audio&#38;gt; element or WebRTC contexts,
&#38;gt; both HTMLAudioElement and WebRTC&#39;s audio systems are &#38;quot;push-based.&#38;quot; By
&#38;gt; design, they should not experience audio sample dropouts or glitches in the
&#38;gt; same way. The WebAudio (pull-based) playback stats are specifically
&#38;gt; designed to catch dropouts so developers can estimate the user&#39;s audio
&#38;gt; quality and experience.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Hopefully this answers your question!
&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; Hey Hongchan,
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; This looks extremely useful!
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; I&#39;m a little surprised to see that the TAG didn&#39;t ask about alignment with
&#38;gt; other APIs in the space, e.g.:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;     &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats&#34;&#38;gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Will we get unified behaviour here? Will it be possible to get similar
&#38;gt; stats from an &#38;lt;audio&#38;gt; element or WebRTC contexts, e.g.?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Best,

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Specification*
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioPlaybackStats&#34;&#38;gt;https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioPlaybackStats&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; This feature adds an AudioContext.playbackStats attribute which returns an
&#38;gt; AudioPlaybackStats object. This object provides audio playback statistics
&#38;gt; such as average latency, minimum/maximum latency, underrun duration, and
&#38;gt; underrun count. This API allows web applications to monitor audio playout
&#38;gt; quality and detect glitches. Note: This feature was previously tracked as
&#38;gt; AudioContext.playoutStats. It has been renamed to
&#38;gt; AudioContext.playbackStats to align with the final Web Audio API
&#38;gt; specification. The old name is supported as a deprecated alias for backward
&#38;gt; compatibility.
&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt; There is currently no way to detect whether WebAudio playout has glitches
&#38;gt; (gaps in the played audio, which typically happens due to underperformance
&#38;gt; in the audio pipeline). There is an existing way to measure the
&#38;gt; instantaneous playout latency using AudioContext.outputLatency, but no
&#38;gt; simple way to measure average/minimum/maximum latency over time. With this
&#38;gt; API, we want to propose a way to be able to measure the delay of that audio
&#38;gt; and the glitchiness of the audio.

Aye. Updated the chromestatus.
Mozilla apparently has already implemented this as part of their
initial support for precommitHandler.

&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;the beforeinput and input events now report deleteContentBackward or

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebNN seeks to enable web applications and frameworks to take advantage
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of native operating system services for machine learning and the underlying
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; hardware capabilities available on a user&#39;s computer to implement
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; consistent, efficient, and reliable ML experiences on the web.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Aside from the risk that other browsers do not implement (which is
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; trending towards unlikely given that Edge is planning to ship alongside
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome and Firefox is planning to implement) the primary interoperability
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; risk is that a WebNN implementation needs to abstract over the ML
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; acceleration capabilities of the underlying platform and hardware. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specification mitigates this risk by defining a set of ML operations which
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; must be supported and provides a feature detection mechanism for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; discovering additional operations that may be optionally supported. This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; allows developers to write broadly interoperable code by using only the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; required operations or design their applications to adapt to additional
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; capabilities at runtime.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Gecko*: Positive (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issues/1215#issuecomment-3520278819)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebKit*: No signal (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issues/486) Apple is participating in the WebML WG but has made no
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; public statements about implementation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Web developers*: Positive Microsoft&#39;s ONNX runtime includes an
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; execution provider for WebNN (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/&#34;&#38;gt;https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; tutorials/web/ep-webnn.html). Google&#39;s LiteRT.js framework has
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; announced that they are working on WebNN support (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HAjotVloAvI?t=219&#34;&#38;gt;https://youtu.be/HAjotVloAvI?t=219&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Other signals*: The WebNN implementation in Chromium is a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; collaboration between Google, Intel, and Microsoft. Edge will be launching
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebNN at the same time as Chrome.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Ergonomics*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; For some use cases, particularly real-time ML processing of video,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; integration between WebNN and WebGPU is required. Support for this has been
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; prototyped on some platforms as an `exportToGPU()` method that takes an
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `MLTensor` and makes it available as a `GPUBuffer` but this is not yet
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; available on all platforms.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Activation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Most developers don&#39;t write JavaScript or WebGPU shader code to execute
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their ML models by hand. Instead frameworks such as LiteRT.js, ONNX Runtime
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Web, WebLLM or Transformers.js are used. Support for WebNN in these
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; frameworks (already starting to appear) will be a large factor in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; adoption of this API.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The primary security risk is exposing the underlying platform frameworks
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to potentially malicious content. This is mitigated through sandboxing of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the GPU process and fuzz testing. The risks are similar to WebGPU, though
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the expressiveness of WebNN is lower than WGSL.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This is a new API.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Goals for experimentation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *No information provided*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Due to GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard#4155
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard/issues/4155&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard/issues/4155&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; wasn&#39;t filled in. It should read:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The goal of this experiment is to understand how well real-world models
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; abstract to the operations supported by WebNN and how well WebNN can map
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; these operations to those supported by the hardware of real-world users.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Ongoing technical constraints*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebNN can currently execute models on CPU across all platforms but
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; support for GPU and NPU execution is more limited. This will expand as
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; development continues.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; There is currently no special DevTools support for this API beyond
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; regular JavaScript debugging. A feature we have considered (and prototyped
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; via an internal extension and the --webnn-coreml-dump-model,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; --webnn-ort-dump-model, and --webnn-tflite-dump-model browser flags) is
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; inspecting graphs constructed by a site and exporting them in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; underlying platform format so that they can be inspected with other tools.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

*Summary*
Adds the loading attribute to &#38;lt;video&#38;gt; and &#38;lt;audio&#38;gt; elements, allowing
developers to defer media resource loading until the element is near the
viewport using loading=&#38;quot;lazy&#38;quot;. This matches the existing lazy loading
behavior for &#38;lt;img&#38;gt; and &#38;lt;iframe&#38;gt; elements, improving page load performance
and reducing data usage. CL:

*Web Feature ID*
Missing feature

*Motivation*
Web developers frequently need to defer loading of video and audio
resources to improve page load performance and reduce data usage,
especially on pages with multiple media elements below the fold. Without
native support, developers must implement custom JavaScript solutions using
Intersection Observer to detect when media elements enter the viewport and
then dynamically set the src attribute. This approach is error-prone, adds
complexity, and cannot integrate with the browser&#39;s preload scanner. The
loading attribute already exists for &#38;lt;img&#38;gt; and &#38;lt;iframe&#38;gt; elements, and
developers expect the same declarative API for media elements. Native lazy
loading allows the browser to optimize resource loading with network-aware
thresholds, properly handle the interaction with autoplay and preload
attributes, and avoid blocking window.onload for offscreen media.

Summary
WebAuthn Conditional Create allows websites to automatically create passkeys 
for existing users that have a matching password saved in their password 
manager.


Blink component
Blink&#38;gt;WebAuthentication


Web Feature ID
No information provided


Motivation
WebAuthn Conditional Create requests let a website (aka a Relying Party or RP) 
create a passkey without prominent modal mediation, if the user has previously 
consented to credential creation. The motivating use case is commonly referred 
to as &#38;quot;passkey upgrades&#38;quot;. Ie, if the browser/credential manager already stores 
an existing password credential for the same website/relying party and user, 
conditional create allows the the website automatically create a matching 
passkey. An explainer with more information is hosted in the W3C WebAuthn wiki:

WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
No information provided



Debuggability
No information provided


Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
Yes
Blink implements this feature on all platforms. On Android, requests are 
forwarded to the native Credential Manager API, where supporting password 
managers need to implement it separately.


Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?
Yes

Anticipated spec changes

Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or interop 
issues. Please list open issues (eg links to known github issues in the project 
for the feature specification) whose resolution may introduce web 
compat/interop risk (eg, changing to naming or structure of the API in a 
non-backward-compatible way).

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hello API Owners,

This feature was launched on Desktop in Chrome 136 and Android in 142, and
we unfortunately forgot to request Intent to Ship approvals. I just
realized this mistake while we were cleaning up old feature flags, my
apologies. Are there any concerns or could we please have retroactive LGTMs?&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

For context, this was an additional feature to WebAuthn that had an already
existing spec and an implementation in WebKit. Several large Relying
Parties have adopted it already.

Thanks,
Martin Kreichgauer

&#38;gt; website/relying party and user, conditional create allows the the website
&#38;gt; automatically create a matching passkey. An explainer with more information

&#38;gt; *Risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt; WebKit already shipped this feature ahead of Blink, so this launch is
&#38;gt; positive for interoperability.

&#38;gt; *Gecko*: No signal
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *WebKit*: Shipped/Shipping (

&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt; *No information provided*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&#38;gt; Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt; Blink implements this feature on all platforms. On Android, requests are
&#38;gt; forwarded to the native Credential Manager API, where supporting password
&#38;gt; managers need to implement it separately.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests

&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; Extends the SpeechRecognition interface by adding a quality property to
&#38;gt; SpeechRecognitionOptions. This allows developers to specify the semantic
&#38;gt; capability required for on-device recognition (via processLocally: true).
&#38;gt; The proposed quality enum supports three levels—&#39;command&#39;, &#39;dictation&#39;, and
&#38;gt; &#39;conversation&#39;—mapping to increasing task complexity and hardware
&#38;gt; requirements. This enables developers to determine if the local device can
&#38;gt; handle high-stakes use cases (like meeting transcription) or if they should
&#38;gt; fallback to cloud services, solving the current &#38;quot;black box&#38;quot; issue of
&#38;gt; on-device model capabilities.

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt; While the introduction of processLocally: true was a significant step for
&#38;gt; privacy and latency, it currently treats all on-device models as
&#38;gt; functionally equivalent. In reality, on-device capabilities are highly
&#38;gt; fragmented: a lightweight model optimized for simple voice commands (e.g.,
&#38;gt; &#38;quot;turn on the lights&#38;quot;) is often insufficient for high-stakes use cases like
&#38;gt; video conferencing transcription or accessibility captioning, which require
&#38;gt; handling continuous speech, multiple speakers, and background noise.
&#38;gt; Because developers currently have no way to verify the semantic capability
&#38;gt; of the local model, they must blindly trust the device or default to
&#38;gt; Cloud-based recognition to guarantee a minimum user experience. This lack
&#38;gt; of transparency forces developers to bypass on-device capabilities for
&#38;gt; high-end use cases, effectively negating the privacy and bandwidth benefits
&#38;gt; of the API. There is a critical need for a mechanism that allows
&#38;gt; applications to define their required &#38;quot;floor&#38;quot; of utility (e.g.,
&#38;gt; conversation-grade accuracy) to confidently utilize local processing.

&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-5/#text-scale-meta&#34;&#38;gt;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-5/#text-scale-meta&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;


Summary
Makes the root element&#39;s default font size scale in proportion to both the 
operating system&#39;s and browser&#39;s text scale setting. This allows pages that 
follow best practices around font-relative units (ie use rem and em for font 
sizes and page elements that should change with the user&#39;s text size 
preferences) to respect the user&#39;s OS-level text scale setting. This also 
causes the browser to disable existing browser-based mechanisms (ie full-page 
zoom on windows) and heuristics (ie text autosizing on mobile). Now web 
developers can signal to the browser that the page is constructed in a way (ie 
with rem and em) that will scale well across various user-selected font size 
preferences. Similar to env(preferred-text-scale), which provides authors with 
a way to access the text scale; this API extends that by enabling scaling via 
the root element&#39;s default font size and opting-out of automatic text scaling.

Motivation
Authors currently don&#39;t have an easy way to respect the OS-level text scale 
setting on all devices. It is practically impossible to detect and respect this 
on desktop. On mobile, there is env(preferred-text-scale), but authors would 
need to use it in calc() functions to set the root font-size and some media 
queries. They would need a lot of guidance to ensure it gets used correctly and 
there would be little variation in how they would use it. Therefore, it would 
be much easier for authors if they could continue to use font-relative units as 
they do now and the UA initial font-size was redefined to incorporate the 
OS-level text scale setting.

Activation
We intend to do some outreach after the feature has baked on Stable. Some ideas 
are discussed at the end of this TAG review comment: 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/1172#issuecomment-3667481287&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/1172#issuecomment-3667481287&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;


WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
No higher risk. This opt-in feature has WebView-specific behaviors. The goal of 
the WebView-specific parts is to allow authors to ensure their pages render 
identically on Chrome and WebView. Today renderings may not be identical due to 
some WebView font-sizing quirks. See commit message at 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7280046&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7280046&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; for more info.



Debuggability

Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
Yes


Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?
No
Not tested in WPT because there is no API to simulate changing user font size 
preferences. The wpt_internal tests are at

*Summary*
The named-feature() function allows CSS @supports rules to query for a
small set of specific named features that are not possible to test for
using other @supports mechanisms but which are considered highly valuable
to test for.

*Motivation*
Sometimes we add new features to CSS where two things are simultaneously
true: first, that CSS authors see high value in writing conditional styles
for whether the feature is supported using @supports, and second, that the
existing mechanisms in @supports don&#39;t provide a useful way to test for the
feature. This provides a way for us to give names to a small number of
high-value features so that CSS authors can test for them in their style
sheets.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Apologies, perhaps I assumed too strongly that it would be considered a
minor extension to the scroll-driven animations API.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

I&#39;ve written an explainer

and updated the chromestatus page with it.
Happy to provide further info.

&#38;gt; So there&#39;s no explainer, no developer feedback, and no examples...are we

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Bramus&#39;s comment also highlights that the &#38;quot;scroll&#38;quot; keyword will be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; particularly useful for Scroll-Triggered Animations:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; it allows authors to effectively create timeline ranges with a single

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature expands the set of named ranges of view timelines, adding a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;scroll&#38;quot; range. The Scroll-Driven Animations API introduced ViewTimelines
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; along with named ranges which refer to portions of a ViewTimeline that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; define an animation&#39;s range[1]. However, all the named ranges provided were
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; restricted to the portion of the ViewTimeline where its subject is visible.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It is useful for authors to be able to refer to the full extent of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; scroll container underlying the timeline. This feature facilitates this by
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; adding a named range of &#38;quot;scroll&#38;quot; to the existing set (&#38;quot;entry&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;exit&#38;quot;,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;cover&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;contain&#38;quot;).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Web Feature ID*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Missing feature
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A scroll-driven animation&#39;s range[1] can be described in terms of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (named) ranges of a ViewTimeline, i.e. &#38;quot;cover&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;contain&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;entry&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;exit.&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This allows authors to tie the progress of the animation directly to the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the position of the ViewTimeline&#39;s subject within the scroll container
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; underlying the ViewTimeline.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; However, ViewTimelines are, by default, constrained to the portion of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the underlying scroll container within which the subject is (wholly or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partially) visible, i.e. the &#38;quot;cover&#38;quot; range, i.e. { rangeStart: cover 0%,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rangeEnd: cover 100%}. This means that an author has no way, for example,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to refer to a range that starts when the subject is visible but ends at the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; end of the scrolling container (rather than when then subject stops being
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; visible). They could opt for a hack like { rangeStart: cover 0%, rangeEnd:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cover 10000%}, having attempted to manually calculate rangeEnd. Similarly,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to set rangeStart, to the start of the scroll container they&#39;d need to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compute some negative percentage or px offset.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; With a named range of &#38;quot;scroll&#38;quot;, the author would write &#38;quot;scroll 0%&#38;quot; or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;scroll 100%&#38;quot; instead of manually-calculated values.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; keyword.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes, authors need this. Not only for Scroll-Driven Animations, but also
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for Scroll-Triggered Animations when you want to implement a trigger that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fires only once. The end of the activation range for such a trigger is then
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; typically set to “scroll 100%”.

Summary
Introduces a new CSS property and pseudo-class to control and detect animated 
images like GIFs and APNGs. 1. image-animation: Can be set to &#38;quot;normal&#38;quot;, 
&#38;quot;running&#38;quot;, or &#38;quot;paused&#38;quot; to control image animation playback. 2. :animated-image: 
A pseudo-class to determine whether an image is animated.


Blink component
Blink&#38;gt;CSS


Web Feature ID
Missing feature


Motivation
Currently, user agents autoplay animated images (eg, GIF, WebP, PNG) by 
default. This behavior can be violate accessibility standards regarding pausing 
and stopping content. Site authors currently lack mechanisms to control this 
playback. The only existing methods are browser-specific global settings, which 
are inconsistent and lack the features needed for developers to build 
accessible, per-image playback interfaces.

&#38;gt; It&#39;s a little odd that there&#39;s no developer feedback here.

Fair point. The main impact is just &#38;quot;you can ship on more devices&#38;quot;, which
developers certainly want, but of course WebGPU must still be usable with
the restrictions. We *do* have positive feedback on that, which we will
follow up with shortly.


&#38;gt; Is it correct that we&#39;re shipping first?

Yes, but more than that, we don&#39;t expect all browsers to ship it ever.
Compatibility mode was specifically designed to interoperate as well as
possible with other browsers that *never* implement it (Safari), and
Safari+Firefox have reviewed the API thoroughly in the WG and approved it
with this in mind. It is expected to be a positive force for WebGPU
adoption overall as it reduces the need for applications to continue to
support WebGL.

Firefox *is* considering implementing Compatibility Mode, but of course it
competes with their priorities for other WebGPU features. (Compatibility
Mode is mostly for old and very-low-spec/below-baseline Android devices,
which are relatively more critical for Chromium as a core Android system
component.)


&#38;gt; And is there a list of features that will not be available in this mode?

The detailed proposal doc enumerates them:
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/blob/main/proposals/compatibility-mode.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/blob/main/proposals/compatibility-mode.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
That should be complete, but of course the final details are in the spec
itself.


&#38;gt; Does it unlock software rendering?

No, only hardware rendering on more devices (that are less capable).

These days, software renderers (WARP, Lavapipe) are among the *more* capable
implementations of graphics APIs, since they have no hardware dependency
and can implement anything with sufficient effort (which has been
happening).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adds an opt-in, lightly restricted subset of the WebGPU API capable of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; running older graphics APIs such as OpenGL and Direct3D11. By opting into
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this mode and obeying its constraints, developers can extend the reach of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their WebGPU applications to many older devices that do not have the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; modern, explicit graphics APIs that core WebGPU requires. For simple
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; applications, the only required change is to specify the &#38;quot;compatibility&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; featureLevel when calling requestAdapter. For more advanced applications,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the mode&#39;s restrictions.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Since Compatibility mode is a subset, the resulting applications are also
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; valid WebGPU Core applications and will run even on user agents that do not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; support Compatibility mode.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebGPU is a good match for modern graphics APIs such as Vulkan, Metal
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and Direct3D 12. However, there are a large number of devices which do not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; yet support those APIs. In particular, on Chrome on Windows, 31% of Chrome
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; users do not have Direct3D FL 11.1 or higher. On Android, 23% of Android
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; users do not have Vulkan 1.1, including 15% who do not have Vulkan at all (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&#34;&#38;gt;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;). On ChromeOS, Vulkan
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; penetration is still quite low, while OpenGL ES 3.1 is ubiquitous.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Developers are thus forced to write multiple implementations (e.g., WebGPU
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and WebGL) for maximum reach, to accept the reduced reach that core WebGPU
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; currently provides, or to write only for WebGL and forgo the advanced
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; features of WebGPU, such as GPU compute. By opting in to Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mode, developers can target a wider reach of devices with a single
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; commits to the compatibility-mode propsal above was approved by a working
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; group member from each of those three organizations, and any disagreements
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; were resolved prior to landing in Working Group meetings.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Being a lightly-restricted subset, Compatibility Mode does not introduce
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; any accessibility, security, or privacy issues over and above those
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduced by core WebGPU. For this reason, the security review submitted
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for WebGPU also applies to Compatibility Mode.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Low; does not remove or alter existing APIs. Provides a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lightly-restricted subset of the WebGPU API to older devices which are not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; capable of the core WebGPU API In case of emergency, there are two
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; independent killswitches: - kWebGPUAndroidOpenGLES controls the Dawn
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; OpenGLES backend on Android in the GPU process - RuntimeEnabledFeature
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; kWebGPUCompatibilityMode controls the JS API in the renderer process

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; All platforms will eventually have support. Will immediately be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; available on Android, Android WebView, ChromeOS, Mac, and Windows, where
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; hardware support is available. Linux is planned to have WebGPU support in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the future, so this feature will become available when WebGPU does.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; All Compatibility Mode restrictions are exercised by the &#38;quot;compatibility&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; option to the WebGPU CTS. E.g., &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://gpuweb.github.io/cts/&#34;&#38;gt;https://gpuweb.github.io/cts/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and part of the testing of Dawn/Tint in Chromium. While the CTS can be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; embedded in WPT, the WebGPU team opted to keep it separate in Chromium
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; testing to use a customized harness for robustness and performance.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mozilla is interested in this feature (and has approved all of the spec
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; changes) but has not committed to implementing it yet. Apple has approved
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; all of the spec changes, but it is not anticipated that this feature will
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ship in Safari since all Apple devices on the market can support the full
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Core WebGPU spec. However, since it is designed as a subset, Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mode applications will work unchanged in browsers that only support Core
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (e.g., Safari).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Feature is used by specific partner(s) to provide functionality within
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 12 months of launch in Chrome.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption plan*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adoption of Core WebGPU proceeds apace (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4029), and it is expected that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers will adopt Compatibility Mode because it allows them to extend
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the reach of their WebGPU content to a larger audience.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; On Android, this feature depends on the OpenGLES 3.1 graphics API in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; order to provide WebGPU capability to older devices. The JavaScript API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will be available on all platforms, including desktop, but will not require
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; any new graphics APIs; it will simply allow developers to test the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Compatibility Mode subset on all Chrome platforms.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; All Compatibility Mode changes have landed in the WebGPU core spec:

&#38;lt;a href=&#34;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&#34; class=&#34;__cf_email__&#34; data-cfemail=&#34;95f8f6f6eff4bbbbbbd5f2f8f4fcf9bbf6faf8&#34;&#38;gt;[email&#38;#160;protected]&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

*Specification*
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://w3c.github.io/gpc&#34;&#38;gt;https://w3c.github.io/gpc&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

*Summary*
Implementation of Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal to enable users to 
communicate their preference for privacy protection across websites. This 
feature implements the W3C GPC specification (
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/gpc/blob/main/explainer.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/gpc/blob/main/explainer.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) and includes: (1) a user 
preference setting to enable the Global Privacy Control signal, (2) 
automatic transmission of the Sec-GPC HTTP header with a value of &#38;quot;1&#38;quot; on 
all outgoing requests when enabled, and (3) JavaScript API exposure via the 
navigator.globalPrivacyControl property allowing websites to detect the 
user&#39;s GPC preference. When enabled, this signal indicates the user&#39;s 
request to limit the sale or sharing of their personal information with 
third parties.

*Blink component*
Blink&#38;gt;Loader

*Motivation*
The signal is already implemented by other browsers and Chrome should 
catch-up with this privacy setting. This year California signed a bill 
under the CCPA/CPRA that obligates the browsers to provide ability to 
communicate do-not-sell-or-share preference before 2027. Currently, Chrome 
allows to send GPC header only via an extension which may be not sufficient 
to be compliant with the bill.

   1. 
   
   Let parsed be the result of parsing 
   &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax/#parse-grammar&#34;&#38;gt;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax/#parse-grammar&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the given value as

So, I intent to implement the percentage unit support for 
context-2d-letterspacing separately at a later time.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Thank you.

&#38;gt; I&#39;m wondering if `CanvasRenderingContext2D.letterSpacing` and 
&#38;gt; `CanvasRenderingContext2D.wordSpacing` should also support percentage 
&#38;gt; values? 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Currently, it seems this isn&#39;t implemented.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; @Mike Taylor @Daniel Bratell would you mind repeating your LGTMs here

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Enables percentage values for the letter-spacing and word-spacing CSS 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; property, as defined in the CSS Text Module Level 4 spec. Percentage values 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; are calculated relative to the advance measure of the space character 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (U+0020). This gives developers more robust and flexible control over 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; typography, particularly in responsive designs where text spacing needs to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; adapt to different viewports and font sizes.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The &#39;letter-spacing&#39; and &#39;word-spacing&#39; properties currently only accept 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fixed length values (e.g. px, em), which are inflexible in responsive 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; designs. When font sizes or container dimensions change, this fixed spacing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; can become disproportionate, forcing developers to write complex media 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; queries or use JavaScript to maintain readable text. Introducing percentage 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; values allows spacing to be defined relative to font-intrinsic metrics. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This enables both letter and word spacing to scale proportionally with the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; font, simplifying the creation of robust and visually consistent typography 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; across all devices without extra code.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Risks are low. This is a support for new value of CSS properties. So 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sites not using properties won&#39;t be affected. Firefox and Safari has 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; supported this feature for years.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Gecko*: Shipped/Shipping Firefox is failing so many letter-spacing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; tests:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But those are related the line ending or boundary handling of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; letter-spacing, not the percentage values. Related discussion:

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Thanks Mike! I was just chasing the Chrome Tooling team on this to see if
anyone else could approve in his absence. They&#39;re aware of the change and
have been liaising with Ane on it. So good to approve.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; Hi Ane,
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The debuggability reviewer is OOO for the next week or so, but based on

&#38;gt; Hi all,
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; I&#39;m following up on the Debuggability gate, which is currently showing as
&#38;gt; overdue by a day on ChromeStatus. I&#39;d like to move forward with completing
&#38;gt; the Intent to Ship process.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; For context, this change modifies Layout Instability API attribution
&#38;gt; rectangles from device pixels to CSS pixels, a units change that aligns
&#38;gt; with other Web Platform APIs (getBoundingClientRect, IntersectionObserver,
&#38;gt; etc.).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; From a debuggability perspective:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    - The API continues to work identically, just reporting CSS pixels
&#38;gt;    instead of device pixels
&#38;gt;    - DevTools Layout Instability tracking remains unchanged
&#38;gt;    - Developers can inspect the values the same way through the
&#38;gt;    PerformanceObserver API
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; If there are specific debuggability concerns or additional information
&#38;gt; needed, I&#39;m happy to provide it. Otherwise, any guidance on how to move
&#38;gt; this gate forward would be greatly appreciated.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Thanks!
&#38;gt; Ane :-)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; As discussed with Barry Pollard offline, in all web docs we assume that

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; When it&#39;s physical pixels that should be the exception that&#39;s documented.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; So after a second reflection, we finally got back to the conclusion that

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We mainly care about RUM data here, but even there, the direct compat risk

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; visible breakage for users, but may create one for developers that use
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; tools that rely on this data.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Summary
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Change Layout Instability API attribution rectangles (`prevRect` and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `currentRect`) from device pixels to CSS pixels. This aligns the API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with other Web Platform measurement APIs (getBoundingClientRect,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver) that use CSS pixels as the standard
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; coordinate system.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Motivation
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The current implementation uses device pixels, which:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Creates inconsistencies across devices with different pixel ratios
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Makes it difficult for developers to correlate layout shift data
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with other measurements
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Deviates from the standard coordinate system used throughout the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; web platform
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; CSS pixels provide a consistent, device-independent unit that aligns
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with developer expectations and simplifies working with layout
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; stability metrics alongside other DOM measurements.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; an existing API, not a new feature. The change aligns Layout Instability
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API attribution rectangles with the standard CSS pixel coordinate system
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; used by other Web Platform APIs. This does not introduce new API surface 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; or

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **Interoperability risk:** Low. This is a measurement/telemetry
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; change that doesn&#39;t affect site functionality. The API is used
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; primarily by monitoring/analytics tools.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **Gecko:** Closed without a position (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1318&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1318&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) -
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mozilla supports CSS pixels for web APIs, though they don&#39;t implement the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Layout Instability API.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **WebKit:** No signal (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/588&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/588&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **Web developers:** Positive feedback from WebPerf Slack community.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The change simplifies working with layout stability metrics.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **Compatibility risk:** Low. Primary consumers are telemetry systems
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (RUM providers, analytics tools) that can adapt their processing.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The change provides more consistent, useful data. Sites using the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API directly will see coordinate values change but can easily adapt
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; by removing device pixel ratio conversions.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **Rollback plan:** Feature can be disabled via flag if unexpected
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issues arise.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Ergonomics
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This change improves ergonomics by aligning with the CSS pixel
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; coordinate system developers already use in other APIs
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (getBoundingClientRect, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver), reducing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; confusion and simplifying debugging.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No security concerns - this changes the unit of measurement for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; existing data, does not expose new information. # WebView
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application risks
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; None. This is a measurement/telemetry change that works consistently
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; across all platforms including WebView.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Debuggability
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No changes to debuggability. The API continues to work the same way,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; just with CSS pixel coordinates instead of device pixels.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes. Web Platform Tests have been updated to verify CSS pixel

This is amazing — thank you both!
Since all the gates are approved, the final step to ship the feature is to 
merge the CL that promotes ReportLayoutShiftRectsInCssPixels to 
stable: &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7261417&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7261417&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Mike, I added you as the code owner, since you’ve been incredibly helpful 
throughout this process.


I can’t believe I’ll see this live soon 🤩 — my Christmas gift *after* 
Christmas 🙂

Thank you!

&#38;gt; Thanks Mike! I was just chasing the Chrome Tooling team on this to see if 
&#38;gt; anyone else could approve in his absence. They&#39;re aware of the change and 
&#38;gt; have been liaising with Ane on it. So good to approve.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The debuggability reviewer is OOO for the next week or so, but based on 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; your answers I&#39;ve gone ahead and approved the bit.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hi all,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;m following up on the Debuggability gate, which is currently showing as 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; overdue by a day on ChromeStatus. I&#39;d like to move forward with completing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the Intent to Ship process.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; For context, this change modifies Layout Instability API attribution 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rectangles from device pixels to CSS pixels, a units change that aligns 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with other Web Platform APIs (getBoundingClientRect, IntersectionObserver, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; etc.).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; From a debuggability perspective:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - The API continues to work identically, just reporting CSS pixels 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    instead of device pixels 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - DevTools Layout Instability tracking remains unchanged 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - Developers can inspect the values the same way through the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    PerformanceObserver API 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; If there are specific debuggability concerns or additional information 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; needed, I&#39;m happy to provide it. Otherwise, any guidance on how to move 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this gate forward would be greatly appreciated.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thanks!
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Ane :-)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; As discussed with Barry Pollard offline, in all web docs we assume that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; pixels = CSS pixels! 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; When it&#39;s physical pixels that should be the exception that&#39;s 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; documented.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; So after a second reflection, we finally got back to the conclusion 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that MDN doesn&#39;t need to be updated.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now, I am looking for my last API Owner approval, can I ping someone or

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The main risk here is for tools that get their input from this data 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and visualize it to users (where the data can be in either synthetic or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RUM). We mainly care about RUM data here, but even there, the direct 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compat 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; risk for actual users is minimal. In other words, this change will not 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; create visible breakage for users, but may create one for developers that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; use tools that rely on this data.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It&#39;s a small change to accommodate this change, is not critical (the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; worst case is the wrong area of the screenshot/animation will be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; highlighted until the change is made) and brings the Layout Instability 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; inline with other Web Platform APIs and most would expect of this. So 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;m 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; supportive of this change, despite this risk.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Summary
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Change Layout Instability API attribution rectangles (`prevRect` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and `currentRect`) from device pixels to CSS pixels. This aligns 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API with other Web Platform measurement APIs 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (getBoundingClientRect, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver) that use CSS pixels as the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; standard 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; coordinate system.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Blink component
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Blink&#38;gt;PerformanceAPIs
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Motivation
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The current implementation uses device pixels, which:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Creates inconsistencies across devices with different pixel ratios
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Makes it difficult for developers to correlate layout shift data 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with other measurements
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Deviates from the standard coordinate system used throughout the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; web platform
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; CSS pixels provide a consistent, device-independent unit that aligns 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with developer expectations and simplifies working with layout 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; stability metrics alongside other DOM measurements.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # TAG review Not applicable - This is a small compatibility fix to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; an existing API, not a new feature. The change aligns Layout 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Instability 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API attribution rectangles with the standard CSS pixel coordinate 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; system 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; used by other Web Platform APIs. This does not introduce new API 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; surface or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; capabilities. # TAG review status Not applicable # Chromium bug

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Risks
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ## Interoperability and Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **Interoperability risk:** Low. This is a measurement/telemetry 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; change that doesn&#39;t affect site functionality. The API is used 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; primarily by monitoring/analytics tools.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **Gecko:** Closed without a position (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1318&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1318&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) - 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mozilla supports CSS pixels for web APIs, though they don&#39;t implement 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Layout Instability API.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **WebKit:** No signal (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/588&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/588&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **Web developers:** Positive feedback from WebPerf Slack community. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The change simplifies working with layout stability metrics.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **Compatibility risk:** Low. Primary consumers are telemetry 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; systems (RUM providers, analytics tools) that can adapt their 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; processing. The change provides more consistent, useful data. Sites 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; using the API directly will see coordinate values change but can easily 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; adapt 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; by removing device pixel ratio conversions.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; **Rollback plan:** Feature can be disabled via flag if unexpected 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issues arise.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Ergonomics
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This change improves ergonomics by aligning with the CSS pixel 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; coordinate system developers already use in other APIs 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (getBoundingClientRect, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver), reducing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; confusion and simplifying debugging. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Activation 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No user activation required - this is a measurement/telemetry API. # 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Security 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No security concerns - this changes the unit of measurement for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; existing data, does not expose new information. # WebView 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application risks 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; None. This is a measurement/telemetry change that works consistently 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; across all platforms including WebView.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Debuggability
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No changes to debuggability. The API continues to work the same way, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; just with CSS pixel coordinates instead of device pixels.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; # Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes. Web Platform Tests have been updated to verify CSS pixel 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; behavior for attribution rectangles.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This is a compatibility fix to align the Layout Instability API with 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; standard Web Platform coordinate systems. The change affects 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; measurement 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; data rather than user-facing functionality, and has low risk of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; breakage. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Primary consumers are RUM/analytics tools that can adapt to the change.

Can you send a fresh intent for this? That would enable the API owners
tooling to pick it up and ensure it&#39;s properly reviewed.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; It contains just the logic to include the signal header and provide

&#38;gt; I haven&#39;t added any user-facing settings as most likely it should be

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hello, I would be happy to pick up the implementation of `Sec-GPC`. Can I
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; continue in this thread or should I start a new one?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Here is a draft of the Intent to Prototype
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This proposal adds support for the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; GPC allows users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a request not to sell or share their personal information.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This implementation involves:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    1.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    Adding a Sec-GPC HTTP request header with a value of 1 when the user
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    has enabled the signal.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    2.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    Exposing a navigator.globalPrivacyControl property in the DOM,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    returning true when enabled.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Blink component*Blink
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1222907:%22Blink%22&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1222907:%22Blink%22&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*The signal is already implemented by other browsers and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome should catch-up with this privacy setting. This year California
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; signed a bill under the CCPA/CPRA that obligates the browsers to provide
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ability to communicate do-not-sell-or-share preference before 2027.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Currently, Chrome allows to send GPC header only via an extension which
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; may be not sufficient to be compliant with the bill.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Search tags* GPC, Global Privacy Control, Privacy, Sec-GPC
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The risk is low as this is an additive feature.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    *Gecko*: Shipped (Enabled by default in Firefox private browsing and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    optional in standard mode).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    *WebKit*: Based on the info from the Internet, the signal is not yet
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    implemented in WebKit
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    *Web developers*: Publishers are obligated to honor the signal.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    *Other signals*: Brave, DuckDuckGo, and other privacy-focused
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    browsers have shipped this.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Ergonomics*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The feature is simple (a boolean flag). It does not introduce complex
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; performance or ergonomic challenges. There is already a similar setting for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; DoNotTrack header.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Activation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Web developers can easily feature-detect navigator.globalPrivacyControl.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature exposes a user preference, which could theoretically be used
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for fingerprinting. However, it is a high-entropy bit intended to be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; broadcast to all sites, similar to DNT (Do Not Track), but with a clearer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; legal framework for enforcement.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications? No.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; DevTools will show the Sec-GPC header in network requests and allow
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; inspecting navigator.globalPrivacyControl in the console.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?*Yes.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No, but tests will be added as part of the prototyping process.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Flag name*

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; And, with respect to the launch process, whoever upstreams this will
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; have to put it in Chrome Status (which I can help with) and send an Intent

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; itself already has a specification.

&#38;gt; And, with respect to the launch process, whoever upstreams this will have 
&#38;gt; to put it in Chrome Status (which I can help with) and send an Intent to 
&#38;gt; Prototype, but you can stop there. While we&#39;d love for you to take it all 
&#38;gt; the way to Intent to Ship and have the discussion about how to have 
&#38;gt; Chromium default-on a feature while Chrome is still undecided about it, you 
&#38;gt; aren&#39;t signing up for that work just by sending your I2P.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thanks for reaching out! This is the right place to publish intents to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; launch new features in Chrome, and an overview of the process can be found 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; here: &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features/&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I believe the prototyping phase is the best place to start given GPC 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; itself already has a specification.

Hello, I would be happy to pick up the implementation of `Sec-GPC`. Can I 
continue in this thread or should I start a new one?&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Here is a draft of the Intent to Prototype

*Contact emails: * &#38;lt;a href=&#34;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&#34; class=&#34;__cf_email__&#34; data-cfemail=&#34;503d33332a317e7e7e10373d31393c7e333f3d&#34;&#38;gt;[email&#38;#160;protected]&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

*Explainer *&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/gpc/blob/main/explainer.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/gpc/blob/main/explainer.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

*Specification* &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://w3c.github.io/gpc/&#34;&#38;gt;https://w3c.github.io/gpc/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

*Summary* 
This proposal adds support for the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal. GPC 
allows users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as a 
request not to sell or share their personal information.

This implementation involves:

   1. 
   
   Adding a Sec-GPC HTTP request header with a value of 1 when the user has 
   enabled the signal.
   2. 
   
   Exposing a navigator.globalPrivacyControl property in the DOM, returning 
   true when enabled.
   

*Blink component*Blink 
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1222907:%22Blink%22&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1222907:%22Blink%22&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;


*Motivation*The signal is already implemented by other browsers and 
Chrome should catch-up with this privacy setting. This year California 
signed a bill under the CCPA/CPRA that obligates the browsers to provide 
ability to communicate do-not-sell-or-share preference before 2027.
Currently, Chrome allows to send GPC header only via an extension which may 
be not sufficient to be compliant with the bill.

*Search tags* GPC, Global Privacy Control, Privacy, Sec-GPC

*Risks*

*Interoperability and Compatibility* 
The risk is low as this is an additive feature.

   - 
   
   *Gecko*: Shipped (Enabled by default in Firefox private browsing and 
   optional in standard mode).
   - 
   
   *WebKit*: Based on the info from the Internet, the signal is not yet 
   implemented in WebKit
   - 
   
   *Web developers*: Publishers are obligated to honor the signal.
   - 
   
   *Other signals*: Brave, DuckDuckGo, and other privacy-focused browsers 
   have shipped this.
   
*Ergonomics* 
The feature is simple (a boolean flag). It does not introduce complex 
performance or ergonomic challenges. There is already a similar setting for 
DoNotTrack header.

*Activation* 
Web developers can easily feature-detect navigator.globalPrivacyControl.

*Security* 
This feature exposes a user preference, which could theoretically be used 
for fingerprinting. However, it is a high-entropy bit intended to be 
broadcast to all sites, similar to DNT (Do Not Track), but with a clearer 
legal framework for enforcement.

*WebView application risks* 
Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that 
it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications? No.

*Debuggability* 
DevTools will show the Sec-GPC header in network requests and allow 
inspecting navigator.globalPrivacyControl in the console.


*Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, 
Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?*Yes.

*Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?* 
No, but tests will be added as part of the prototyping process.

*Flag name* 
--enable-blink-features=GlobalPrivacyControl

*Tracking bug* &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40745270&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40745270&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; And, with respect to the launch process, whoever upstreams this will have 
&#38;gt; to put it in Chrome Status (which I can help with) and send an Intent to 
&#38;gt; Prototype, but you can stop there. While we&#39;d love for you to take it all 
&#38;gt; the way to Intent to Ship and have the discussion about how to have 
&#38;gt; Chromium default-on a feature while Chrome is still undecided about it, you 
&#38;gt; aren&#39;t signing up for that work just by sending your I2P.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Maxim ended up abandoning the CL to add GPC for lack of time, but support 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; exists for any contributor who wants to pick that torch back up.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; If you&#39;re interested please reach out to myself or Jeffrey (cc&#39;d) for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; support on the code and/or on navigating the launch process.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thanks for reaching out! This is the right place to publish intents to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; launch new features in Chrome, and an overview of the process can be found

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I believe the prototyping phase is the best place to start given GPC 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; itself already has a specification.

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt; Aside from the risk that other browsers do not implement (which is
&#38;gt; trending towards unlikely given that Edge is planning to ship alongside
&#38;gt; Chrome and Firefox is planning to implement) the primary interoperability
&#38;gt; risk is that a WebNN implementation needs to abstract over the ML
&#38;gt; acceleration capabilities of the underlying platform and hardware. The
&#38;gt; specification mitigates this risk by defining a set of ML operations which
&#38;gt; must be supported and provides a feature detection mechanism for
&#38;gt; discovering additional operations that may be optionally supported. This
&#38;gt; allows developers to write broadly interoperable code by using only the
&#38;gt; required operations or design their applications to adapt to additional
&#38;gt; capabilities at runtime.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Gecko*: Positive (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; issues/1215#issuecomment-3520278819)
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *WebKit*: No signal (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; issues/486) Apple is participating in the WebML WG but has made no public
&#38;gt; statements about implementation.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Web developers*: Positive Microsoft&#39;s ONNX runtime includes an execution
&#38;gt; provider for WebNN (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/&#34;&#38;gt;https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; tutorials/web/ep-webnn.html). Google&#39;s LiteRT.js framework has announced
&#38;gt; that they are working on WebNN support (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HAjotVloAvI?t=219&#34;&#38;gt;https://youtu.be/HAjotVloAvI?t=219&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; ).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Other signals*: The WebNN implementation in Chromium is a collaboration
&#38;gt; between Google, Intel, and Microsoft. Edge will be launching WebNN at the
&#38;gt; same time as Chrome.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Ergonomics*
&#38;gt; For some use cases, particularly real-time ML processing of video,
&#38;gt; integration between WebNN and WebGPU is required. Support for this has been
&#38;gt; prototyped on some platforms as an `exportToGPU()` method that takes an
&#38;gt; `MLTensor` and makes it available as a `GPUBuffer` but this is not yet
&#38;gt; available on all platforms.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Activation*
&#38;gt; Most developers don&#39;t write JavaScript or WebGPU shader code to execute
&#38;gt; their ML models by hand. Instead frameworks such as LiteRT.js, ONNX Runtime
&#38;gt; Web, WebLLM or Transformers.js are used. Support for WebNN in these
&#38;gt; frameworks (already starting to appear) will be a large factor in the
&#38;gt; adoption of this API.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt; The primary security risk is exposing the underlying platform frameworks
&#38;gt; to potentially malicious content. This is mitigated through sandboxing of
&#38;gt; the GPU process and fuzz testing. The risks are similar to WebGPU, though
&#38;gt; the expressiveness of WebNN is lower than WGSL.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&#38;gt; This is a new API.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Goals for experimentation*
&#38;gt; *No information provided*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Due to GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard#4155
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard/issues/4155&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard/issues/4155&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this
&#38;gt; wasn&#39;t filled in. It should read:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The goal of this experiment is to understand how well real-world models
&#38;gt; abstract to the operations supported by WebNN and how well WebNN can map
&#38;gt; these operations to those supported by the hardware of real-world users.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Ongoing technical constraints*
&#38;gt; WebNN can currently execute models on CPU across all platforms but support
&#38;gt; for GPU and NPU execution is more limited. This will expand as development
&#38;gt; continues.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt; There is currently no special DevTools support for this API beyond regular
&#38;gt; JavaScript debugging. A feature we have considered (and prototyped via an
&#38;gt; internal extension and the --webnn-coreml-dump-model,
&#38;gt; --webnn-ort-dump-model, and --webnn-tflite-dump-model browser flags) is
&#38;gt; inspecting graphs constructed by a site and exporting them in the
&#38;gt; underlying platform format so that they can be inspected with other tools.

&#38;gt; Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*

Summary
Shows elastic overscroll effects on non-root scroll containers. When a nested 
scrollable element reaches its scroll boundary, the overscroll affordance 
applies to that element instead of only the root scroller. This reduces the 
need for custom Javascript workarounds and can be controlled per element with 
overscroll-behavior.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Responding for Suresh since he&#39;s OOO this week. We have UKM metrics that

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; document this change through our public devrel outreach and also reach out
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to IDPs that we detected through our metrics. While the number of sites
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that would break today due to this is relatively high, the number of IDPs
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is fairly small, so we are confident we can deploy once we know it would
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cause no breakage.

&#38;gt; Except we&#39;ve now had at least one web compat incident due to a major RP
&#38;gt; who doesn&#39;t depend on an IDP-served SDK, right?
&#38;gt;

This change does not depend on an SDK, it is purely server-side (requires

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cross-site identity correlation risks in the FedCM API, Identity Providers
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (IdPs) that utilize client_metadata within their FedCM configuration
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; are required to implement the direct endpoints format in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; .well-known/web-identity file. This mandate ensures that both
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; accounts_endpoint and login_url are explicitly defined whenever a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; client_metadata_endpoint is present. This approach strengthens privacy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; protections by preventing relying parties from exploiting metadata to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; correlate user identities across multiple sites. For further details and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; discussion, refer to &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/700&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/700&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Migration Plan Chrome will enforce this rule in two phases:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome 143 (Warning Phase): If client_metadata_endpoint exists but
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; accounts_endpoint or login_url is missing, the browser will display
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; console warnings. This gives IdPs time to update configurations.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome 145 (Enforcement Phase): The requirement becomes mandatory.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; FedCM configurations missing these endpoints will be blocked, preventing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authentication flows.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this apply to both passive mode and active mode? &#38;quot;Preventing
&#38;gt; authentication flows&#38;quot; for passive mode seems like a completely trivial 
&#38;gt; severity
&#38;gt; of breakage
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RC-pBBvsazYfCNNUSkPqAVpSpNJ96U8trhNkfV0v9fk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.u5ya6jvru7dl&#34;&#38;gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RC-pBBvsazYfCNNUSkPqAVpSpNJ96U8trhNkfV0v9fk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.u5ya6jvru7dl&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;  since
&#38;gt; it just means an optional extra UI doesn&#39;t show up. But any breakage for
&#38;gt; active mode (where a user has just clicked on a &#38;quot;sign-in&#38;quot;) button seems
&#38;gt; very serious. So if the latter, I think we&#39;d want to see UseCounter data
&#38;gt; proving that the usage has been migrated before approving a breaking change.
&#38;gt;

It does apply to both, yeah.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; IdPs failing to update .well-known/web-identity for FedCM client
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; metadata risk breaking authentication flows. Chrome 143 issues warnings,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but starting Chrome 145, missing accounts_endpoint or login_url will block
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; configurations entirely. Immediate migration is critical to maintain

Summary
The Event Timing API is part of the Performance Timeline and is used to measure 
the performance of user interactions. Certain Events will have an interactionId 
value assigned to them, and this is useful for grouping related interactions 
based on common physical user inputs or gestures. This feature adds a very 
trivial performance.interactionCount, which is just the total number of 
interactions that have occured on the page. In particular, this feature is 
useful for computing the Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metric value, which 
requires knowing the total number of interactions in order to compute a high 
percentile score (p98 for pages with greater than 50 total interactions). This 
feature has been specced for a long while, was prototypes in Chromium a long 
time ago but never shipped, is part of Interop 2025, and is already available 
in other browsers. (Note: there is already a more powerful 
performance.eventCounts map for specific events, but it is not possible to 
accurately map event cunts to interaction counts.)

event-timing


Motivation
Used to count the number of important real user interactions with a page. This 
is distinct from counting the number of events that Event Timing measures 
(because a single physical user gesture may fire many, variable number, of 
specific events, depending on the type of input and event target and page 
design) but you can already count interactions (inconveniently) by just 
counting the number of unique interactionId values in Event Timing API. Used 
for calculating Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metric.

Risks




Interoperability and Compatibility
Other browser venders have already shipped this feature as part of the Interop 
2025 effort for CWV INP. The main interop risk is that there are existing 
polyfills for interactionCount in Chromium for INP calculation. However, 
popular polyfills (such as web-vitals.js) have long been tested to feature 
detect, given the long experimental web platform implementation in chromium.

WebKit: In development (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=297361&#34;&#38;gt;https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=297361&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)

Web developers: Strongly positive No specific link, but this feature is related 
to the very popular INP metric definition (and obviates the need for an 
imperfect polyfill for counting interactions).

Other signals:


WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
n/a



Debuggability
DevTools has existing support for Interactions (real time performance monitor 
and tracing). Visualizing total interactionCount is not needed, but can be 
easily found (via literally counting the list of interactions, or just console 
logs).


Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?

&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Thanks for pointing out Mozilla&#39;s response. I think they have some fair 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;points.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;If we look at the list, it is clear from domain names, that some sites, 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;or entities, will benefit more from others from faster first-loads. I 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;mean, something like 30% of the list are from Google entities, from very 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;harmless (IMHO) hosted fonts to analytics, ads and video hosting 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;(YouTube). Some other big sites like Shopify and Wix/parastorage combine 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;to another 15%.

&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;may. The existence of the list is scary and I lack the data to 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;understand what the pros are both in scale and area. Is the disk space 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;issue a real problem or just something that is a potential concern 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;lacking investigation, for instance?
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;I understand that the published list is not a final, set-in-stone, item, 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;so I will not comment on individual items, but what thought have there 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;been on maintaining such a list long term? It seems to me that it might 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;become an area of contention that would be nice to avoid.

    Sorry, I missed a step in making the candidate resource list
    public. I have moved it to my chromium account and made it public
    here
    
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgWhdeqKbGm6hLM9WqnnXLn-iiO4Y9HTjDXjVO2aBqI/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&#38;gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgWhdeqKbGm6hLM9WqnnXLn-iiO4Y9HTjDXjVO2aBqI/edit?usp=sharing&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.


    Not everything in that list meets all of the criteria - it&#39;s just
    the first step in the manual curation (same URL served the same
    content across &#38;gt; 20k sites in the HTTP Archive dataset).

    The manual steps frome there for meeting the criteria are basically:

    - Cull the list for scripts, stylesheets and compression dictionaries.
    - Remove any URLs that use query parameters.
    - Exclude any responses that set cookies.
    - Identify URLs that are not manually versioned by site embedders
    (i.e. the embedded resource can not get stale). This is either
    in-place updating resources or automatically versioned resources.
    - Only include URLs that can reliably target a single resource by
    pattern (i.e. ..../&#38;lt;hash&#38;gt;-common.js but not ..../&#38;lt;hash&#38;gt;.js)
    - Get confirmation from the resource owner that the given URL
    Pattern is and will continue to be appropriate for the
    single-keyed cache

        Assuming we have the privacy and security concerns under
        control (which we&#39;re pretty confident is the case for the
        extremely small subset of resources we are talking about), the
        main discussion point is the balancing of incentives and
        &#38;quot;playing favorites&#38;quot;.

        As you noted, the performance impact is relatively small but
        it&#39;s not non-zero when you get to the scale of some of the
        resources we are talking about (like
        &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; which is on 10M
        of the pages in the 50M page HTTP Archive dataset). This isn&#39;t
        really a framework discussion because those kinds of resources
        aren&#39;t a good fit for the restrictions that are in place for
        the privacy and security protections but there is a discussion
        about providing network benefits to specific third-parties
        that cross the pervasive threshold and meet the rest of the
        conditions (for at least part of the library).

        The question is if the marginal performance benefit that can
        only be realized at that level of scale (where a given user
        would be likely to have the current version of that specific
        library in cache) would be a meaningful competitive factor for
        a newcomer (vs features, ease of use, pricing, mindshare, etc).

        That also gets balanced against the user benefit of not having
        to keep re-downloading the exact same thing and from having to
        keep dozens of copies of it in cache, cached with different
        cache keys (taking cache space away from other resources).

        There&#39;s also a more nuanced benefit that allows for federation
        of a feature across domains vs centralizing the experience.
        For example, Shopify and Wix&#39;s platform libraries show up in
        the candidate list as they are used by hundreds of thousands
        of sites in the CrUX dataset. Having a shared cache for those
        libraries would put them into a more competitive position
        against centralized platforms (Amazon, Etsy, Blogger, etc)
        while still allowing sites to own the overall experience.

        I guess that&#39;s the long way of saying &#38;quot;it&#39;s complicated but we
        feel pretty strongly that the theoretical risk in this case is
        more than offset by the platform benefits&#38;quot;.

            Nothing is being pre-populated (other than the list of URL
            patterns). When a &#38;quot;pervasive&#38;quot; resource is encountered
            naturally by a given user, it will be stored in a
            single-keyed cache instead of a site/frame/url-keyed cache
            (reducing storage duplication for that specific resource
            for that specific user).

            The linked doc has all of the mitigations in place, but
            the big one for explicit tracking is that it can only be
            used when full cookie access is also allowed, otherwise it
            falls through to the fully-partitioned cache.

                            *Summary*
                            For a small number (hundreds) of
                            hand-curated static third-party script,
                            stylesheet and compression-dictionary
                            resources that are used on a large portion
                            of the web, Chrome will use a single-keyed
                            HTTP cache to store those resources.

                            This helps users and site owners with
                            faster performance for those resources
                            that are very widely used while
                            maintaining the privacy protections of the
                            partitioned disk cache. This feature
                            targets the resources that most users are
                            likely to see multiple times across
                            multiple sites in any given browsing
                            session. They are usually not in the
                            critical path of the page loading and may
                            not impact the common performance metrics
                            but they are still important for the
                            healthy operation of the web.

                            The list of candidate resources is
                            manually curated from the HTTP Archive
                            dataset and updated on an ongoing basis.
                            This includes site-independent things like
                            common analytics scripts, social media
                            embeds, video player embeds, captcha
                            providers and ads libraries.

                            It allows for code that uses versioned
                            URLs as long as the versioning is not a
                            manual process by embedders and that the
                            same version is sent to everybody at a
                            given point in time with the same
                            contents. This does not include things
                            like common Javascript libraries where
                            they are commonly self-hosted or where the
                            URL references a specific version of the
                            library and it is up to site owners to
                            manually select a version.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;To clarify, are we approved for what we called the warning phase for both
the nonce parameter and the error rename? Then, we&#39;d send a separate intent
for the enforcement phase for both of these, with data showing usage drop.
Is that correct?&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; We discussed this at API owners:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The general sense is that this intent may be doing too many things.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; We&#39;re happy to approve this intent as shipping the new location for the
&#38;gt; parameter and deprecating the old location (with a warning).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; However, we also believe that the removal (in Chrome 145) has to be a
&#38;gt; separate intent to remove requiring separate approvals. For the removal, we
&#38;gt; would want to see stats to see that the usage is dropping due to
&#38;gt; deprecation low enough that the risk of removal is acceptable.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Does that sound like a reasonable path forward?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Responding for Suresh since he&#39;s OOO this week. For breakage, we already
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; have UKM metrics for any UI breakage (the error API usage from the IDP side
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; may cause the UI to look differently when some error occurs). I noticed we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; don&#39;t have metrics on the JS getter side, so we will add those since the RP
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; side can also break with this change. We plan to have outreach publicly
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; through our devrel channels and also talking to the few IDPs that use the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; error API. Since FedCM use mainly happens through SDKs, we&#39;re confident
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that the combination of public announcement plus IDP outreach will
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sufficiently mitigate the breakage, even if we find that today the number
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of sites using this is currently high.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Summary
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Migration of nonce to params Field: The nonce parameter in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; navigator.credentials.get() is moving from a top-level field to the params
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; object for better API design, extensibility, and maintainability. This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; structured approach simplifies parsing for Identity Providers, supports
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; future-proofing without versioning, and aligns with modern API patterns.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; For Relying Parties, the impact is minimal—they provide the same nonce
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; value in a new location. Migration Plan Chrome will enforce this rule
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in two phases: Chrome 143 (Warning Phase): nonce accepted both at top
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; level and inside params. Top-level usage triggers a console warning. Chrome
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 145 (Enforcement Phase): Top-level nonce removed; must be passed within
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; params. Rename code to error in IdentityCredentialError: The code
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; attribute in IdentityCredentialError is renamed to error for clearer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; semantics, better developer experience, and alignment with web standards.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This change reduces ambiguity and avoids conflicts with DOMException.code.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Additionally, error.code becomes error.error, retaining its DOMString type. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Migration
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Plan Chrome will enforce this rule in two phases: Chrome 143 (Warning
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Phase): Both error and code attributes are supported. Using code
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; triggers a console warning, guiding developers to migrate. Chrome 145
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (Enforcement Phase): Attribute code will be removed, only attribute
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; error remains. Update code before this version to prevent breakage. Blink

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome 143 allows old and new patterns with warnings. By Chrome 145,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; top-level nonce and code attributes are removed, requiring params for nonce
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and error for IdentityCredentialError. Failure to migrate breaks
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authentication and error handling, runtime issues, and degraded user
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; experience.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Can you say more about the expected impact here? The severity of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; breakage sounds pretty high - do we have a sense of how many sites will be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; affected, etc?

Summary

The Writer API can be used for writing new material given a writing task
prompt, backed by an on-device AI language model. Developers will be able
to use this API to generate textual explanations of structured data,
composing a post about a product based on reviews or product description,
expanding on pro and con lists into full views and more. An enterprise
policy (GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings) is available to disable the
underlying model downloading which will render the API unavailable.

Risks


Interoperability and Compatibility

This feature has definite interoperability and compatibility risks, due to
the likelihood that different implementations will use different language
models, prompts, and fine-tunings, and even within a single implementation
such as Chrome, these pieces will likely change over time. Additionally,
not all browsers and operating systems will have a built-in language model
to expose, and not all devices will be powerful enough to run one
effectively. We are taking a variety of steps to attempt to mitigate these
risks. For example, the specification is designed to allow the API to be
backed by a cloud-based language model. This approach could extend the
functionality to a wider range of devices and users. The API is designed to
abstract away the specifics of the underlying language model, including
prompts and fine-tuning. This prevents developers from relying on specific
outputs, ensuring they receive newly-written text rather than structured
data that might vary across implementations. Finally, the API surface is
designed with many clear points of failure, that encourage the developer to
probe for capabilities ahead of time and fall back to other techniques if a
capability is not available. Nevertheless, interoperability and
compatibility risk remains high for these sorts of APIs, and we&#39;ll be
closely monitoring it during the experiment period.

Gecko: Negative (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1067&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1067&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)

WebKit: No signal (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/393&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/393&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)

Web developers: Mixed signals (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues/163&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues/163&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
Prototyping with partners behind a flag revealed enthusiasm and many
prototypes built, from which we drew the discussion of potential use cases
[1]. Feedback on the WICG thread was more mixed. Some themes we saw
include: asking for more capabilities (e.g. full prompting of a language
model instead of higher-level APIs (our response at [2]); multi-modal
support); desire to make sure the API actually works robustly in many
real-world use cases; removal of any safety/ethical safeguards; and
confusion about client-side vs. cloud APIs. [1]:

Other signals:

Activation

This feature would definitely benefit from having polyfills, backed by any
of: cloud services, lazily-loaded client-side models using WebGPU, or the
web developer&#39;s own server. We anticipate seeing an ecosystem of such
polyfills grow as more developers experiment with this API.

WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

No information provided


Goals for experimentation

Although developers have prototyped using the behind-a-flag implementation
and given good feedback, several partners are interested in testing out the
API with real users. We&#39;re looking forward to getting feedback from such
testing, especially with regards to output quality, multilingual support,
and what types of writing tasks are handled well vs. poorly. We also want
to understand whether we&#39;ve found the right set of options to offer to
control the output, and whether the resulting output reflects those
controls to the extent that developers expect.


Reason this experiment is being extended

Writer API suffers from perceived quality issues and a critical language
support disconnect. These APIs are currently not production-ready for many
use cases, particularly those outside of English. In addition, we are also
seeing low adoption in the OT phase for this API. Hence, we are requesting
the extension of the trial to give us time to collect more feedback from
our partners and make the API more robust and resilient.

Ongoing technical constraints

As discussed above, not all devices are capable of running the language
models required to implement this API. The availability() function allows
developers to feature-detect whether the current device can support the API.

Debuggability

It is possible that giving DevTools more insight into the nondeterministic
states of the model, e.g. random seeds, could help with debugging. See
related discussion at
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/prompt-api/issues/9&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/prompt-api/issues/9&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;.

Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?

No

Not all platforms will come with a language model. In particular, in the
initial stages we are focusing on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
?

No

The API surface is reasonably well tested with mocked models, but
production model downloading and non-deterministic outputs are not fully
tested at the web-platform-tests layer. The explainer discusses this in
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/writing-assistance-apis/blob/main/README.md#specifications-and-tests&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/writing-assistance-apis/blob/main/README.md#specifications-and-tests&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

Non-OSS dependencies

Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?

Yes: this feature depends on a language model, which is bridged to the
open-source parts of the implementation via the interfaces in
//services/on_device_model.

Summary

The Rewriter API transforms and rephrases input text in requested ways,
backed by an on-device AI language model. Developers may use this API to
remove redundancies within a text in order to fit into a word limit,
rephrase messages to suit the intended audience or to be more constructive
if a message is found to use toxic language, rephrasing a post or article
to use simpler words and concepts and more. An enterprise policy
(GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings) is available to disable the
underlying model downloading which will render the API unavailable.

Risks


Interoperability and Compatibility

This feature has definite interoperability and compatibility risks, due to
the likelihood that different implementations will use different language
models, prompts, and fine-tunings, and even within a single implementation
such as Chrome, these pieces will likely change over time. Additionally,
not all browsers and operating systems will have a built-in language model
to expose, and not all devices will be powerful enough to run one
effectively. We are taking a variety of steps to attempt to mitigate these
risks. For example, the specification is designed to allow the API to be
backed by a cloud-based language model. This approach could extend the
functionality to a wider range of devices and users. The API is designed to
abstract away the specifics of the underlying language model, including
prompts and fine-tuning. This prevents developers from relying on specific
outputs, ensuring they receive rewritten text rather than structured data
that might vary across implementations. Finally, the API surface is
designed with many clear points of failure, that encourage the developer to
probe for capabilities ahead of time and fall back to other techniques if a
capability is not available. Nevertheless, interoperability and
compatibility risk remains high for these sorts of APIs, and we&#39;ll be
closely monitoring it during the experiment period.

Prototyping with partners behind a flag revealed enthusiasm and many
prototypes built, from which we drew the discussion of potential use cases
[1]. Feedback on the WICG thread was more mixed. Some themes we saw
include: asking for more capabilities (e.g. full prompting of a language
model instead of higher-level APIs (our response at [2]); multi-modal
support); desire to make sure the API actually works robustly in many
real-world use cases; removal of any safety/ethical safeguards; and
confusion about client-side vs. cloud APIs. [1]:

Other signals:

Activation

This feature would definitely benefit from having polyfills, backed by any
of: cloud services, lazily-loaded client-side models using WebGPU, or the
web developer&#39;s own server. We anticipate seeing an ecosystem of such
polyfills grow as more developers experiment with this API.

WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

No information provided


Goals for experimentation

Although developers have prototyped using the behind-a-flag implementation
and given good feedback, several partners are interested in testing out the
API with real users. We&#39;re looking forward to getting feedback from such
testing, especially with regards to output quality, multilingual support,
and what types of input data are handled well vs. poorly. We also want to
understand whether we&#39;ve found the right set of options to offer to control
the output, and whether the resulting output reflects those controls to the
extent that developers expect.

Reason this experiment is being extended

Rewriter API suffers from perceived quality issues and a critical language
support disconnect. These APIs are currently not production-ready for many
use cases, particularly those outside of English. In addition, we are also
seeing low adoption in the OT phase for this API. Hence, we are requesting
the extension of the trial to give us time to collect more feedback from
our partners and make the API more robust and resilient.

Ongoing technical constraints

As discussed above, not all devices are capable of running the language
models required to implement this API. The availability() function allows
developers to feature-detect whether the current device can support the API.

Debuggability

It is possible that giving DevTools more insight into the nondeterministic
states of the model, e.g. random seeds, could help with debugging. See
related discussion at
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/prompt-api/issues/9&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/prompt-api/issues/9&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;.

Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?

No

Not all platforms will come with a language model. In particular, in the
initial stages we are focusing on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
?

No

The API surface is reasonably well tested with mocked models, but
production model downloading and non-deterministic outputs are not fully
tested at the web-platform-tests layer. The explainer discusses this in

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Responding for Suresh since he&#39;s OOO this week. We have UKM metrics that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; tell us which IDPs would break today due to this change. We plan to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; document this change through our public devrel outreach and also reach out
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to IDPs that we detected through our metrics. While the number of sites
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that would break today due to this is relatively high, the number of IDPs
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is fairly small, so we are confident we can deploy once we know it would
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cause no breakage.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Except we&#39;ve now had at least one web compat incident due to a major RP
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; who doesn&#39;t depend on an IDP-served SDK, right?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; This change does not depend on an SDK, it is purely server-side (requires
&#38;gt; certain fields in the well-known file)
&#38;gt;

Ah, of course, thanks. That definitely makes the risk quite low then since
we&#39;re basically in touch with every IDP using FedCM in production at this
stage.

In general the way API owners prefer to handle breaking changes is to
approve them once we have the data showing conclusively that the risk is
low. That said, I see how this is really a privacy bugfix and we wouldn&#39;t
necessarily want to say that we&#39;re making this change only if IDPs adapt to
it. Given that we&#39;re in direct contact with the handful of people who would
need to change this at scale, in this particular case I&#39;m personally
comfortable approving the plan in advance (other API owners may feel
differently). So LGTM1 from me.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Migration Plan Chrome will enforce this rule in two phases:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome 143 (Warning Phase): If client_metadata_endpoint exists but
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; accounts_endpoint or login_url is missing, the browser will display
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; console warnings. This gives IdPs time to update configurations.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome 145 (Enforcement Phase): The requirement becomes mandatory.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; FedCM configurations missing these endpoints will be blocked, preventing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authentication flows.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this apply to both passive mode and active mode? &#38;quot;Preventing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authentication flows&#38;quot; for passive mode seems like a completely trivial 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; severity
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of breakage
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RC-pBBvsazYfCNNUSkPqAVpSpNJ96U8trhNkfV0v9fk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.u5ya6jvru7dl&#34;&#38;gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RC-pBBvsazYfCNNUSkPqAVpSpNJ96U8trhNkfV0v9fk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.u5ya6jvru7dl&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  since
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; it just means an optional extra UI doesn&#39;t show up. But any breakage for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; active mode (where a user has just clicked on a &#38;quot;sign-in&#38;quot;) button seems
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; very serious. So if the latter, I think we&#39;d want to see UseCounter data
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; proving that the usage has been migrated before approving a breaking change.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; It does apply to both, yeah.
&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; IdPs failing to update .well-known/web-identity for FedCM client
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; metadata risk breaking authentication flows. Chrome 143 issues warnings,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but starting Chrome 145, missing accounts_endpoint or login_url will block
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; configurations entirely. Immediate migration is critical to maintain
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compatibility and avoid service disruptions for relying parties and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; end-users.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Similar to the previous email, can you say something about expected
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; impact/usage here? And how confident are we that IdPs are going to be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; paying attention to console warnings?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Gecko: No signal (Firefox does not wish to support the client metadata

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Same as other FedCM features. The network view in devtools would be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; especially helpful for debugging this feature.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No, FedCM in general is not supported on webview. Supported on all
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; other blink platforms.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Yes, that would be the plan. This intent when approved would cover both new
nonce parameter and the error rename up to and including the &#38;quot;warning
phase&#38;quot;. A separate intent will be required for the &#38;quot;enforcement phase&#38;quot; (one
intent for both error rename and nonce parameter).&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; To clarify, are we approved for what we called the warning phase for both
&#38;gt; the nonce parameter and the error rename? Then, we&#39;d send a separate intent
&#38;gt; for the enforcement phase for both of these, with data showing usage drop.
&#38;gt; Is that correct?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We discussed this at API owners:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The general sense is that this intent may be doing too many things.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re happy to approve this intent as shipping the new location for the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; parameter and deprecating the old location (with a warning).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; However, we also believe that the removal (in Chrome 145) has to be a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; separate intent to remove requiring separate approvals. For the removal, we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; would want to see stats to see that the usage is dropping due to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; deprecation low enough that the risk of removal is acceptable.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does that sound like a reasonable path forward?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Responding for Suresh since he&#39;s OOO this week. For breakage, we already
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; have UKM metrics for any UI breakage (the error API usage from the IDP side
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; may cause the UI to look differently when some error occurs). I noticed we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; don&#39;t have metrics on the JS getter side, so we will add those since the RP
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; side can also break with this change. We plan to have outreach publicly
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; through our devrel channels and also talking to the few IDPs that use the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; error API. Since FedCM use mainly happens through SDKs, we&#39;re confident

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sufficiently mitigate the breakage, even if we find that today the number
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of sites using this is currently high.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Summary
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Migration of nonce to params Field: The nonce parameter in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; navigator.credentials.get() is moving from a top-level field to the params
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; object for better API design, extensibility, and maintainability. This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; structured approach simplifies parsing for Identity Providers, supports
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; future-proofing without versioning, and aligns with modern API patterns.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; For Relying Parties, the impact is minimal—they provide the same nonce
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; value in a new location. Migration Plan Chrome will enforce this rule
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in two phases: Chrome 143 (Warning Phase): nonce accepted both at top
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; level and inside params. Top-level usage triggers a console warning. Chrome
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 145 (Enforcement Phase): Top-level nonce removed; must be passed
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; within params. Rename code to error in IdentityCredentialError: The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; code attribute in IdentityCredentialError is renamed to error for clearer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; semantics, better developer experience, and alignment with web standards.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This change reduces ambiguity and avoids conflicts with DOMException.code.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Additionally, error.code becomes error.error, retaining its DOMString 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; type. Migration
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Plan Chrome will enforce this rule in two phases: Chrome 143 (Warning
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Phase): Both error and code attributes are supported. Using code
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; triggers a console warning, guiding developers to migrate. Chrome 145
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (Enforcement Phase): Attribute code will be removed, only attribute
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; error remains. Update code before this version to prevent breakage. Blink

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome 143 allows old and new patterns with warnings. By Chrome 145,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; top-level nonce and code attributes are removed, requiring params for nonce
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and error for IdentityCredentialError. Failure to migrate breaks
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authentication and error handling, runtime issues, and degraded user
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; experience.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Can you say more about the expected impact here? The severity of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; breakage sounds pretty high - do we have a sense of how many sites will be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; affected, etc?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; especially helpful for debugging this feature.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; NoFedCM in general is not supported on webview. Supported on all other
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; blink platforms.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hi Mike

Thanks for the email.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

I requested reviews for the Privacy, WP Security, Enterprise, Debuggability, 
and Testing bits.

Could not find the Draft intent to ship button which generates the email 
template. If you can share details
on where that is or why it doesn&#39;t show up for the feature (Maybe some 
information in the prepare to ship or
earlier section is incomplete/incorrect?) 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5186046555586560?gate=5179324311011328&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5186046555586560?gate=5179324311011328&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

Do we need to wait for the other reviews to finish before requesting API Owners 
review?

Thanks
Ananta

Hey there,


This Intent to Ship is missing a lot of what API OWNERs need to evaluate before 
approving. You should be able to generate a template email from Chromestatus - 
feel free to reach out to me privately if you can&#39;t figure that out.


Also, in your chromestatus entry, please request approvals for the Privacy, WP 
Security, Enterprise, Debuggability, and Testing bits, thanks.


thanks,
Mike

Hi Blink Dev/Owners

I’d like to signal intent to ship the new field rtpTimestamp on 
VideoFrame.metadata() as defined in the WebCodecs VideoFrame Metadata 
Registry&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.

What it adds:
The metadata().rtpTimestamp field allows applications using 
MediaStreamTrackProcessor for frame rendering to access the original RTP 
timestamp of a decoded video frame.

Status:
• Chromium CLs and WPT tests have landed and merged.
• Tests are upstream in WPT PR 
55392&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/55392&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/55392&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.
• Implementation behind --enable-blink-features=VideoFrameMetadataRtpTimestamp  
flags has been running in Canary.
• We intend to flip the default-on flag for milestone M146.

Risk and monitoring:
• API change is additive — existing code continues to function without change.
• No known interoperability issues or security/privacy risks; full Self-Review 
has been carried out.
• Monitoring via WPT pass rate, usage counters, and developer feedback 
post-unlock.
Rollout plan:
• Flag flip to enabled-by-default in Chromium M146 (desktop and Android).
• No WebView / iOS surface at ship time; these inherit defaults later.
• No Finch experiment planned; will roll out to all users once approved.

Requests for Owners:
• Please review and approve the feature for the ship stage if it looks ok.
• Once approved, I will upload the flag flip CL and reference this intent.

Thanks

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;The level of importance for the healthy operation of the web is opinion and
debatable but for everything that is determined to be pervasive and safe to
include, it will marginally increase the reliability and/or performance of
that item loading. Likely fractions of a percent improvement in things like
conversion measurement, successful checkouts or recaptcha challenges
succeeding. Unlikely to be noticed in individual samples but meaningful for
the web at scale. My personal opinion is that these marginal improvements
are important for the overall health of the web but others may disagree (or
determine that the benefits are not worth the complexity).&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

As far as disk space goes, the overall cache size is a concern on lower-end
devices but it&#39;s not clear how much this will improve any individual user&#39;s
cache. There is probably a lot that could be done in that space to age-out
stale versioned resources and prioritize render-blocking resources but it&#39;s
another marginal cost that we can recover.

As far as maintaining the list long-term, there has been a fair bit of
thought put into the process. The list itself has an expiration to make
sure we don&#39;t get stuck with stale copies if, for some reason, it stops
being maintained (yeah, I&#39;m still sore about reader). There is tooling to
automate the building of the candidate list and there are plans to improve
the automation around filtering the list for patterns to make it much
easier to update. It will also be in the git repo so it&#39;s not restricted to
the core maintainers to keep it updated (i.e. if a provider has a pattern
that is in the candidate list but hasn&#39;t been added yet, they can submit a
CL). The list of patterns is expected to be pretty stable once the initial
build-out has been completed though since the patterns are expected to be
long-lived and popularity at that scale doesn&#39;t change quickly (the privacy
protections require the stability to prevent history sniffing).

&#38;gt; Thanks for pointing out Mozilla&#39;s response. I think they have some fair
&#38;gt; points.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; If we look at the list, it is clear from domain names, that some sites, or
&#38;gt; entities, will benefit more from others from faster first-loads. I mean,
&#38;gt; something like 30% of the list are from Google entities, from very harmless
&#38;gt; (IMHO) hosted fonts to analytics, ads and video hosting (YouTube). Some
&#38;gt; other big sites like Shopify and Wix/parastorage combine to another 15%.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Having your key resources on that list may not matter very much, or it
&#38;gt; may. The existence of the list is scary and I lack the data to understand
&#38;gt; what the pros are both in scale and area. Is the disk space issue a real
&#38;gt; problem or just something that is a potential concern lacking
&#38;gt; investigation, for instance?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; I understand that the published list is not a final, set-in-stone, item,
&#38;gt; so I will not comment on individual items, but what thought have there been
&#38;gt; on maintaining such a list long term? It seems to me that it might become
&#38;gt; an area of contention that would be nice to avoid.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; In the initial intent, the claim was that this is important for the
&#38;gt; healthy operation of the web. But is it really?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Not everything in that list meets all of the criteria - it&#39;s just the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; first step in the manual curation (same URL served the same content across
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 20k sites in the HTTP Archive dataset).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The manual steps frome there for meeting the criteria are basically:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Cull the list for scripts, stylesheets and compression dictionaries.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Remove any URLs that use query parameters.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Exclude any responses that set cookies.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Identify URLs that are not manually versioned by site embedders (i.e.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the embedded resource can not get stale). This is either in-place updating
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resources or automatically versioned resources.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Only include URLs that can reliably target a single resource by pattern
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (i.e. ..../&#38;lt;hash&#38;gt;-common.js but not ..../&#38;lt;hash&#38;gt;.js)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Get confirmation from the resource owner that the given URL Pattern is
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and will continue to be appropriate for the single-keyed cache

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Assuming we have the privacy and security concerns under control (which
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; we&#39;re pretty confident is the case for the extremely small subset of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resources we are talking about), the main discussion point is the balancing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of incentives and &#38;quot;playing favorites&#38;quot;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; As you noted, the performance impact is relatively small but it&#39;s not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; non-zero when you get to the scale of some of the resources we are talking
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; about (like &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; which is on
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 10M of the pages in the 50M page HTTP Archive dataset). This isn&#39;t really a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; framework discussion because those kinds of resources aren&#39;t a good fit for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the restrictions that are in place for the privacy and security protections
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but there is a discussion about providing network benefits to specific
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; third-parties that cross the pervasive threshold and meet the rest of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; conditions (for at least part of the library).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The question is if the marginal performance benefit that can only be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; realized at that level of scale (where a given user would be likely to have
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the current version of that specific library in cache) would be a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; meaningful competitive factor for a newcomer (vs features, ease of use,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; pricing, mindshare, etc).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; That also gets balanced against the user benefit of not having to keep
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; re-downloading the exact same thing and from having to keep dozens of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; copies of it in cache, cached with different cache keys (taking cache space
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; away from other resources).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; There&#39;s also a more nuanced benefit that allows for federation of a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature across domains vs centralizing the experience. For example, Shopify
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and Wix&#39;s platform libraries show up in the candidate list as they are used
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; by hundreds of thousands of sites in the CrUX dataset. Having a shared
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cache for those libraries would put them into a more competitive position
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; against centralized platforms (Amazon, Etsy, Blogger, etc) while still
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; allowing sites to own the overall experience.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I guess that&#39;s the long way of saying &#38;quot;it&#39;s complicated but we feel
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; pretty strongly that the theoretical risk in this case is more than offset
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; by the platform benefits&#38;quot;.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; When a &#38;quot;pervasive&#38;quot; resource is encountered naturally by a given user, it
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will be stored in a single-keyed cache instead of a site/frame/url-keyed
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cache (reducing storage duplication for that specific resource for that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specific user).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The linked doc has all of the mitigations in place, but the big one for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; explicit tracking is that it can only be used when full cookie access is
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; also allowed, otherwise it falls through to the fully-partitioned cache.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This is interesting, given all of the problems involved in governance

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I expect it will change over time but the changes should be pretty
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; minor (as new resources increase or decrease popularity). Generally we&#39;d
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; want to include resources that have been common for a while and are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; likely
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to continue to be common.  I&#39;d expect small changes every milestone (or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; two).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; For a small number (hundreds) of hand-curated static third-party
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; script, stylesheet and compression-dictionary resources that are used 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; on a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; large portion of the web, Chrome will use a single-keyed HTTP cache to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; store those resources.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This helps users and site owners with faster performance for those
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resources that are very widely used while maintaining the privacy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; protections of the partitioned disk cache. This feature targets the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resources that most users are likely to see multiple times across 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; multiple
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sites in any given browsing session. They are usually not in the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; critical
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; path of the page loading and may not impact the common performance 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; metrics
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but they are still important for the healthy operation of the web.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The list of candidate resources is manually curated from the HTTP
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Archive dataset and updated on an ongoing basis. This includes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; site-independent things like common analytics scripts, social media 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; embeds,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video player embeds, captcha providers and ads libraries.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It allows for code that uses versioned URLs as long as the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; versioning is not a manual process by embedders and that the same 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; version
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is sent to everybody at a given point in time with the same contents. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; does not include things like common Javascript libraries where they are
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; commonly self-hosted or where the URL references a specific version of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; library and it is up to site owners to manually select a version.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; i.e.

Hi Mike&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Thanks for the email.

&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;I requested reviews for the Privacy, WP Security, Enterprise, 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Debuggability, and Testing bits.

&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/blockquote&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Nope. API OWNER review can happen in parallel, but you should wait for

Hey there,


&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;This Intent to Ship is missing a lot of what API OWNERs need to 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;evaluate before approving. You should be able to generate a template 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;email from Chromestatus - feel free to reach out to me privately if 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;you can&#39;t figure that out.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Also, in your chromestatus entry, please request approvals for the 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Privacy, WP Security, Enterprise, Debuggability, and Testing bits, thanks.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;


thanks,

Hi Blink Dev/Owners

&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;I’d like to signal intent to ship the new field |rtpTimestamp| on 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;|VideoFrame.metadata()| as defined in the WebCodecs VideoFrame 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Metadata Registry 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;
*
*
*What it adds:*
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;The |metadata().rtpTimestamp| field allows applications using 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;MediaStreamTrackProcessor for frame rendering to access the original 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;RTP timestamp of a decoded video frame.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

*Status:*
• Chromium CLs and WPT tests have landed and merged.
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Tests are upstream in WPT PR 55392 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/55392&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/55392&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Implementation behind 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;|--enable-blink-features=VideoFrameMetadataRtpTimestamp|  flags has 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;been running in Canary.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;
• We intend to flip the default-on flag for milestone *M146*.
*
*
*Risk and monitoring:*
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• API change is additive — existing code continues to function 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;without change.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• No known interoperability issues or security/privacy risks; full 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Self-Review has been carried out.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Monitoring via WPT pass rate, usage counters, and developer 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;feedback post-unlock.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;
*Rollout plan:*
• Flag flip to enabled-by-default in Chromium M146 (desktop and Android).
• No WebView / iOS surface at ship time; these inherit defaults later.
• No Finch experiment planned; will roll out to all users once approved.

*Requests for Owners:*
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Please review and approve the feature for the ship stage if it 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;looks ok.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Once approved, I will upload the flag flip CL and reference this 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;intent.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

Thanks

&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;first step in the manual curation (same URL served the same content 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;across &#38;gt; 20k sites in the HTTP Archive dataset).
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

The manual steps frome there for meeting the criteria are basically:

- Cull the list for scripts, stylesheets and compression dictionaries.
- Remove any URLs that use query parameters.
- Exclude any responses that set cookies.
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;- Identify URLs that are not manually versioned by site embedders 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;(i.e. the embedded resource can not get stale). This is either 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;in-place updating resources or automatically versioned resources.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;- Only include URLs that can reliably target a single resource by 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;pattern (i.e. ..../&#38;lt;hash&#38;gt;-common.js but not ..../&#38;lt;hash&#38;gt;.js)
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;- Get confirmation from the resource owner that the given URL Pattern 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;is and will continue to be appropriate for the single-keyed cache
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/blockquote&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

A few questions on list curation:

&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Can you clarify how big the list will be? The privacy review at 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5202380930678784?gate=5174931459145728 mentions&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5202380930678784?gate=5174931459145728 mentions&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;~500, while the design doc mentions 1000. I see the candidate resource 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;list starts at ~5000, then presumably manual curation begins to get to 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;one of those numbers.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

What is the expected list curation/update cadence? Is it actually manual?

&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Is there any recourse process for owners of resources that don&#39;t want to 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;be included? Do we have documentation on what it mean to be appropriate 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;for the single-keyed cache?
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

Specification
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

Summary
Adds a VideoFrame.metadata() method that returns a dictionary containing the 
rtpTimestamp field, if the underlying VideoFrame has this field in its native 
metadata. An empty dictionary is returned otherwise. Only video frames 
originating from WebRTC sources will have the rtpTimestamp metadata attached. 
Additional metadata fields are already present in the native implementation and 
may be exposed to JavaScript over time, as outlined in the proposed spec:

Motivation
This feature exposes the rtpTimestamp field on the JavaScript facing 
VideoFrame.metadata dictionary when it is present in the underlying native 
media::VideoFrameMetadata. It allows applications using 
MediaStreamTrackProcessor (e.g., to render decoded WebRTC frames to a canvas) 
or WebCodecs (e.g., for custom decoding pipelines) to correlate each exposed 
frame with its original RTP transport timestamp. This is useful for: Media 
synchronization across tracks Jitter or latency diagnostics Aligning decoded 
video with captured or received audio Spec link:

Risks


Interoperability and Compatibility
The feature is additive and backward compatible. Existing WebCodecs and WebRTC 
APIs remain unchanged.
        No known interop issues. WPT coverage validates expected behavior. 
Firefox and WebKit positions are         pending.

Gecko: No signal (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1233&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1233&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) 
Position request filed on May 19, 2025. Awaiting response.

WebKit: No signal (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/497&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/497&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) 
Position request filed on May 19, 2025. Awaiting a response from WebKit.

Web developers: No signals

Other signals:

WebView application risks
Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
None. This feature only exposes additional read only metadata (rtpTimestamp) on 
VideoFrame objects that are already surfaced through WebCodecs and WebRTC 
pipelines. No changes to existing Android WebView behavior or APIs. Safe for 
WebView.


Debuggability
No impact to DevTools workflows. Feature testing is via JS API inspection and 
WPT automation.
VideoFrame metadata inspection (including rtpTimestamp) can be done via 
Javascript using MediaStreamTrackProcessor and WebCodecs/WebRTC or automated 
via WebDriver BiDi tests.

Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
Yes

Is this feature fully tested by 
web-platform-tests&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;?

Flag name on about://flags
--enable-blink-features=VideoFrameMetadataRtpTimestamp

Finch feature name
None. Rollout is via milestone 146 stable. No finch experiment planned.

Non-finch justification
The feature is additive and backward compatible. Existing WebCodecs and WebRTC 
APIs remain unchanged.

Rollout plan
Will ship enabled for all users

Requires code in //chrome?
False

Availability expectation
Available by default in Chrome 146 for all desktop platforms. Mobile 
availability (Android) expected to follow in the same milestone.

Adoption expectation
Expected to be adopted by WebRTC and streaming applications that correlate 
decoded VideoFrame metadata with RTP timestamps for synchronization and 
telemetry. This includes browser based streaming clients that use 
MediaStreamTrackProcessor.

Adoption plan
Ship enabled by default for all users in Chrome 146. Coordinate with developers 
via WPT test results and the published ChromeStatus entry. No developer facing 
migration required.

Non-OSS dependencies
Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open source 
repository and its open-source dependencies to function?
None. The feature is implemented entirely within Chromium’s open source stack 
(WebRTC, Blink, and WebCodecs)

Estimated milestones
Shipping on desktop
146
Shipping on Android
146
Shipping on WebView
146

Anticipated spec changes
Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or interop 
issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues in the 
project for the feature specification) whose resolution may introduce web 
compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of the API in a 
non-backward-compatible way).
None expected. This feature implements the rtpTimestamp entry in the WebCodecs 
VideoFrame Metadata Registry and matches the current registry text (name, type, 
and semantics). The registry status is “W3C Draft Registry,” but any further 
edits we expect to be editorial or additive. If a normative change were 
proposed (e.g., semantics/units&#39; clarification or constraints), we would align 
Chromium accordingly and update tests.

Hi Mike

Thanks for the email.

Thank you!

Could not find the Draft intent to ship button which generates the email 
template. If you can share details
on where that is or why it doesn&#39;t show up for the feature (Maybe some 
information in the prepare to ship or
earlier section is incomplete/incorrect?) 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5186046555586560?gate=5179324311011328&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5186046555586560?gate=5179324311011328&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
It can be a little hard to find - if you click on the &#38;quot;API Owners&#38;quot; chip you 
should see a blue &#38;quot;Draft Intent to Ship email&#38;quot; on the top-right (it&#39;s possible 
you didn&#39;t see this before because I had marked this as &#38;quot;needs work&#38;quot;, but it 
should be visible now).

Do we need to wait for the other reviews to finish before requesting API Owners 
review?
Nope. API OWNER review can happen in parallel, but you should wait for all 
review to be approved before shipping.

Thanks
Ananta

Hey there,


This Intent to Ship is missing a lot of what API OWNERs need to evaluate before 
approving. You should be able to generate a template email from Chromestatus - 
feel free to reach out to me privately if you can&#39;t figure that out.


Also, in your chromestatus entry, please request approvals for the Privacy, WP 
Security, Enterprise, Debuggability, and Testing bits, thanks.


thanks,
Mike

Hi Blink Dev/Owners

I’d like to signal intent to ship the new field rtpTimestamp on 
VideoFrame.metadata() as defined in the WebCodecs VideoFrame Metadata 
Registry&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.

What it adds:
The metadata().rtpTimestamp field allows applications using 
MediaStreamTrackProcessor for frame rendering to access the original RTP 
timestamp of a decoded video frame.

Status:
• Chromium CLs and WPT tests have landed and merged.
• Tests are upstream in WPT PR 
55392&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/55392&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/55392&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.
• Implementation behind --enable-blink-features=VideoFrameMetadataRtpTimestamp  
flags has been running in Canary.
• We intend to flip the default-on flag for milestone M146.

Risk and monitoring:
• API change is additive — existing code continues to function without change.
• No known interoperability issues or security/privacy risks; full Self-Review 
has been carried out.
• Monitoring via WPT pass rate, usage counters, and developer feedback 
post-unlock.
Rollout plan:
• Flag flip to enabled-by-default in Chromium M146 (desktop and Android).
• No WebView / iOS surface at ship time; these inherit defaults later.
• No Finch experiment planned; will roll out to all users once approved.

Requests for Owners:
• Please review and approve the feature for the ship stage if it looks ok.
• Once approved, I will upload the flag flip CL and reference this intent.

Thanks

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;The candidate list goes down to 20k occurrences in order to catch resources
that were updated mid-crawl and may have multiple entries with different
hashes that add up to 100k+ occurrences. In the candidate list, without any
filtering, the 100k cutoff is around 600, I&#39;d estimate that well less than
25% of the candidates make it through the filtering for stable pattern,
correct resource type and reliable pattern. First release will likely be
100-200 and I don&#39;t expect it will ever grow above 500.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

As far as cadence goes, I expect there will be a lot of activity for the
next few releases as individual patterns are coordinated with the origin
owners but then it will settle down to a much more bursty pattern of
updates every few Chrome releases (likely linked with an origin changing
their application and adding more/different resources). And yes, it is
manual.

As far as the process goes, resource owners need to actively assert that
their resource is appropriate for the single-keyed cache and that they
would like it included (usually in response to active outreach from us but
we have the external-facing list for owner-initiated contact as well).  The
design doc has the documentation for what it means to be appropriate (and
the doc will be moved to a readme page in the repository next to the actual
list so it&#39;s not a hard-to-find Google doc):

5. Require resource owner opt-in
For each URL to be included, reach out to the team/company responsible for
the resource to validate the URL pattern and get assurances that the
pattern will always serve the same content to all sites and not be abused
for tracking (by using unique URLs within the pattern mask as a bit-mask
for fingerprinting). They will also need to validate that the URLs covered
by the pattern will not rely on being able to set cookies over HTTP using a
Set-Cookie HTTP response header because they will not be re-applied across
cache boundaries (the set-cookie is not cached with the resource).

&#38;gt; Sorry, I missed a step in making the candidate resource list public. I
&#38;gt; have moved it to my chromium account and made it public here
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgWhdeqKbGm6hLM9WqnnXLn-iiO4Y9HTjDXjVO2aBqI/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&#38;gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgWhdeqKbGm6hLM9WqnnXLn-iiO4Y9HTjDXjVO2aBqI/edit?usp=sharing&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Not everything in that list meets all of the criteria - it&#39;s just the
&#38;gt; first step in the manual curation (same URL served the same content across
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 20k sites in the HTTP Archive dataset).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The manual steps frome there for meeting the criteria are basically:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; - Cull the list for scripts, stylesheets and compression dictionaries.
&#38;gt; - Remove any URLs that use query parameters.
&#38;gt; - Exclude any responses that set cookies.
&#38;gt; - Identify URLs that are not manually versioned by site embedders (i.e.
&#38;gt; the embedded resource can not get stale). This is either in-place updating
&#38;gt; resources or automatically versioned resources.
&#38;gt; - Only include URLs that can reliably target a single resource by pattern
&#38;gt; (i.e. ..../&#38;lt;hash&#38;gt;-common.js but not ..../&#38;lt;hash&#38;gt;.js)
&#38;gt; - Get confirmation from the resource owner that the given URL Pattern is
&#38;gt; and will continue to be appropriate for the single-keyed cache
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; A few questions on list curation:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Can you clarify how big the list will be? The privacy review at
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5202380930678784?gate=5174931459145728&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5202380930678784?gate=5174931459145728&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; 
&#38;gt; mentions
&#38;gt; ~500, while the design doc mentions 1000. I see the candidate resource list
&#38;gt; starts at ~5000, then presumably manual curation begins to get to one of
&#38;gt; those numbers.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; What is the expected list curation/update cadence? Is it actually manual?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Is there any recourse process for owners of resources that don&#39;t want to
&#38;gt; be included? Do we have documentation on what it mean to be appropriate for
&#38;gt; the single-keyed cache?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; thanks,
&#38;gt; Mike

Hi Mike

Thanks for the email.

&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;I requested reviews for the Privacy, WP Security, Enterprise,

Hey there,


&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;This Intent to Ship is missing a lot of what API OWNERs need to 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;evaluate before approving. You should be able to generate a template 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;email from Chromestatus - feel free to reach out to me privately if 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;you can&#39;t figure that out.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Also, in your chromestatus entry, please request approvals for the 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Privacy, WP Security, Enterprise, Debuggability, and Testing bits, 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;thanks.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;


thanks,

Hi Blink Dev/Owners

&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;I’d like to signal intent to ship the new field |rtpTimestamp| on 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;|VideoFrame.metadata()| as defined in the WebCodecs VideoFrame 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Metadata Registry 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;
*
*
*What it adds:*
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;The |metadata().rtpTimestamp| field allows applications using 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;MediaStreamTrackProcessor for frame rendering to access the original 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;RTP timestamp of a decoded video frame.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

*Status:*
• Chromium CLs and WPT tests have landed and merged.
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Tests are upstream in WPT PR 55392 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/55392&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/55392&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Implementation behind 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;|--enable-blink-features=VideoFrameMetadataRtpTimestamp|  flags has 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;been running in Canary.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;
• We intend to flip the default-on flag for milestone *M146*.
*
*
*Risk and monitoring:*
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• API change is additive — existing code continues to function 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;without change.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• No known interoperability issues or security/privacy risks; full 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Self-Review has been carried out.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Monitoring via WPT pass rate, usage counters, and developer 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;feedback post-unlock.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;
*Rollout plan:*
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Flag flip to enabled-by-default in Chromium M146 (desktop and 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Android).
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;
• No WebView / iOS surface at ship time; these inherit defaults later.
• No Finch experiment planned; will roll out to all users once approved.

*Requests for Owners:*
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Please review and approve the feature for the ship stage if it 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;looks ok.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;• Once approved, I will upload the flag flip CL and reference this 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;intent.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

Thanks

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Ok, sounds good. Requesting lgtms for the warning phase then. Will we need
a separate chromestatus later to request approval for the enforcement phase?&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; Yes, that would be the plan. This intent when approved would cover both
&#38;gt; new nonce parameter and the error rename up to and including the &#38;quot;warning
&#38;gt; phase&#38;quot;. A separate intent will be required for the &#38;quot;enforcement phase&#38;quot; (one
&#38;gt; intent for both error rename and nonce parameter).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; To clarify, are we approved for what we called the warning phase for both
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the nonce parameter and the error rename? Then, we&#39;d send a separate intent
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for the enforcement phase for both of these, with data showing usage drop.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Is that correct?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The general sense is that this intent may be doing too many things.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re happy to approve this intent as shipping the new location for the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; parameter and deprecating the old location (with a warning).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; However, we also believe that the removal (in Chrome 145) has to be a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; separate intent to remove requiring separate approvals. For the removal, we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; would want to see stats to see that the usage is dropping due to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; deprecation low enough that the risk of removal is acceptable.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does that sound like a reasonable path forward?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Responding for Suresh since he&#39;s OOO this week. For breakage, we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; already have UKM metrics for any UI breakage (the error API usage from the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; IDP side may cause the UI to look differently when some error occurs). I
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; noticed we don&#39;t have metrics on the JS getter side, so we will add those
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; since the RP side can also break with this change. We plan to have outreach
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; publicly through our devrel channels and also talking to the few IDPs that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; use the error API. Since FedCM use mainly happens through SDKs, we&#39;re
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; confident that the combination of public announcement plus IDP outreach
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will sufficiently mitigate the breakage, even if we find that today the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; number of sites using this is currently high.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Summary
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Migration of nonce to params Field: The nonce parameter in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; navigator.credentials.get() is moving from a top-level field to the params
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; object for better API design, extensibility, and maintainability. This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; structured approach simplifies parsing for Identity Providers, supports
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; future-proofing without versioning, and aligns with modern API patterns.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; For Relying Parties, the impact is minimal—they provide the same nonce
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; value in a new location. Migration Plan Chrome will enforce this rule
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in two phases: Chrome 143 (Warning Phase): nonce accepted both at top
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; level and inside params. Top-level usage triggers a console warning. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 145 (Enforcement Phase): Top-level nonce removed; must be passed
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; within params. Rename code to error in IdentityCredentialError: The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; code attribute in IdentityCredentialError is renamed to error for clearer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; semantics, better developer experience, and alignment with web standards.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This change reduces ambiguity and avoids conflicts with DOMException.code.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Additionally, error.code becomes error.error, retaining its DOMString 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; type. Migration
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Plan Chrome will enforce this rule in two phases: Chrome 143 (Warning
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Phase): Both error and code attributes are supported. Using code
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; triggers a console warning, guiding developers to migrate. Chrome 145
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (Enforcement Phase): Attribute code will be removed, only attribute
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; error remains. Update code before this version to prevent breakage. Blink

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome 143 allows old and new patterns with warnings. By Chrome 145,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; top-level nonce and code attributes are removed, requiring params for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; nonce
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and error for IdentityCredentialError. Failure to migrate breaks
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authentication and error handling, runtime issues, and degraded user
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; experience.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Can you say more about the expected impact here? The severity of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; breakage sounds pretty high - do we have a sense of how many sites will be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; affected, etc?

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; The ViewTransition automatically constructs a pseudo-element tree to
&#38;gt; display and animate participating elements in the transition. Per spec,
&#38;gt; this subtree is constructed when the view transition starts animating and
&#38;gt; is destroyed when the animations associated with all view transition
&#38;gt; pseudo-elements are in the finished state (or more precisely in a
&#38;gt; non-running non-paused state). This works for a vast majority of cases and
&#38;gt; provides a seamless experience for the developers. However, for more
&#38;gt; advanced cases, this is insufficient as there are times when developers
&#38;gt; want the view transition pseudo-tree to persist beyond the animation finish
&#38;gt; state. One example is tying view transitions with Scroll Driven Animations.
&#38;gt; When the animation is controlled by a scroll timeline, we don&#39;t want the
&#38;gt; subtree to be destroyed when the animations finish since scrolling back
&#38;gt; should still be able to animate the pseudo elements. In order to enable
&#38;gt; advanced uses of view transition, this intent adds a waitUntil() function
&#38;gt; on the ViewTransition object which takes a promise. This promise then
&#38;gt; delays destruction of the pseudo-tree until it is settled.

It appears the new color space in WPT still lacks testing for CSS 
gradients. Could this be added?&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

e.g.

`background-image: linear-gradient(to right in display-p3-linear, red, 
blue);`

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lists most of the things we want to know before sending a feature out into 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the wild wild world.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; One of the main questions regards compatibility. We want what we do to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; end up in a web where browsers agree on how something should be rendered 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which is why we typically require new features to probe Mozilla and WebKit 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; through their web standards positions (unless they have already shipped).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Another aspect of compatibility, and risk, is about web compatibility. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will this change break things? Are we really, really sure? That is why we 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; typically require every feature to have a finch flag so that at least 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Google Chrome can turn off something that causes unexpected problems. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; When I say &#38;quot;typical&#38;quot;, it&#39;s because no rule fits all, but then we instead 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; need to know why a certain rule does not apply. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You will also see that we ask for some info texts, explainer, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specification, that many implementers consider obvious. Often it is not 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; obvious for other people though, and these texts end up in official blog 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; posts and in other external communication.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you want to look).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The form seems fields seem to be mostly left empty. I don&#39;t think 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; anything should be empty (though a N/A may fit some things). I have 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; questions, but they would mostly be answered by filling in the form and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; re-posting it.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hello blink-dev!
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This very simple feature adds display-p3-linear as a CSS color space. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This has been added to the CSS specification and has a bazillion WPT tests

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It has been requested as a candidate for interop 2026:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; More relevant to the topics close to my heart are the fact that this is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a very good space for physically based rendering and high dynamic range. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adding this space to the list of canvas spaces is a separate feature over

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;This makes a lot of sense but why did this end up as `.metadata()` when

&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-encoded-transform/#dom-rtcencodedvideoframe-getmetadata&#34;&#38;gt;https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-encoded-transform/#dom-rtcencodedvideoframe-getmetadata&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
which it is going to be used in concert with calls it `.getMetadata()`?
Guido or Harald might know...&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Has this shipped in other browsers or could this still be fixed?

&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; Adds a VideoFrame.metadata() method that returns a dictionary containing
&#38;gt; the rtpTimestamp field, if the underlying VideoFrame has this field in its
&#38;gt; native metadata. An empty dictionary is returned otherwise. Only video
&#38;gt; frames originating from WebRTC sources will have the rtpTimestamp metadata
&#38;gt; attached. Additional metadata fields are already present in the native
&#38;gt; implementation and may be exposed to JavaScript over time, as outlined in
&#38;gt; the proposed spec:

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt; This feature exposes the rtpTimestamp field on the JavaScript facing
&#38;gt; VideoFrame.metadata dictionary when it is present in the underlying native
&#38;gt; media::VideoFrameMetadata. It allows applications using
&#38;gt; MediaStreamTrackProcessor (e.g., to render decoded WebRTC frames to a
&#38;gt; canvas) or WebCodecs (e.g., for custom decoding pipelines) to correlate
&#38;gt; each exposed frame with its original RTP transport timestamp. This is
&#38;gt; useful for: Media synchronization across tracks Jitter or latency

&#38;gt; *Risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt; The feature is additive and backward compatible. Existing WebCodecs and
&#38;gt; WebRTC APIs remain unchanged.
&#38;gt; No known interop issues. WPT coverage validates expected behavior. Firefox
&#38;gt; and WebKit positions are pending.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Gecko*: No signal (
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1233&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1233&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) Position

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt; *Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?*
&#38;gt; None. This feature only exposes additional read only metadata
&#38;gt; (rtpTimestamp) on VideoFrame objects that are already surfaced through
&#38;gt; WebCodecs and WebRTC pipelines. No changes to existing Android WebView
&#38;gt; behavior or APIs. Safe for WebView.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt; No impact to DevTools workflows. Feature testing is via JS API inspection
&#38;gt; and WPT automation.
&#38;gt; VideoFrame metadata inspection (including rtpTimestamp) can be done via
&#38;gt; Javascript using MediaStreamTrackProcessor and WebCodecs/WebRTC or
&#38;gt; automated via WebDriver BiDi tests.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&#38;gt; Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by **web-platform-tests

&#38;gt; *Flag name on about://flags*
&#38;gt; --enable-blink-features=VideoFrameMetadataRtpTimestamp
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Finch feature name*
&#38;gt; None. Rollout is via milestone 146 stable. No finch experiment planned.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Non-finch justification*
&#38;gt; The feature is additive and backward compatible. Existing WebCodecs and
&#38;gt; WebRTC APIs remain unchanged.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Rollout plan*
&#38;gt; Will ship enabled for all users
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Requires code in //chrome?*
&#38;gt; False
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt; Available by default in Chrome 146 for all desktop platforms. Mobile
&#38;gt; availability (Android) expected to follow in the same milestone.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt; Expected to be adopted by WebRTC and streaming applications that correlate
&#38;gt; decoded VideoFrame metadata with RTP timestamps for synchronization and
&#38;gt; telemetry. This includes browser based streaming clients that use
&#38;gt; MediaStreamTrackProcessor.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Adoption plan*
&#38;gt; Ship enabled by default for all users in Chrome 146. Coordinate with
&#38;gt; developers via WPT test results and the published ChromeStatus entry. No
&#38;gt; developer facing migration required.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt; *Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&#38;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?*
&#38;gt; None. The feature is implemented entirely within Chromium’s open source
&#38;gt; stack (WebRTC, Blink, and WebCodecs)
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Estimated milestones*
&#38;gt; Shipping on desktop
&#38;gt; 146
&#38;gt; Shipping on Android
&#38;gt; 146
&#38;gt; Shipping on WebView
&#38;gt; 146
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Anticipated spec changes*
&#38;gt; *Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).*
&#38;gt; None expected. This feature implements the rtpTimestamp entry in the
&#38;gt; WebCodecs VideoFrame Metadata Registry and matches the current registry
&#38;gt; text (name, type, and semantics). The registry status is “W3C Draft
&#38;gt; Registry,” but any further edits we expect to be editorial or additive. If
&#38;gt; a normative change were proposed (e.g., semantics/units&#39; clarification or
&#38;gt; constraints), we would align Chromium accordingly and update tests.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Good catch, gradients in linear color space is a very plausible use case
that we should test. Chris, can you add a test for this? I presume there
are other tests that can be copied.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; It appears the new color space in WPT still lacks testing for CSS

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; One of the main questions regards compatibility. We want what we do to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; end up in a web where browsers agree on how something should be rendered
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which is why we typically require new features to probe Mozilla and WebKit
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; through their web standards positions (unless they have already shipped).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Another aspect of compatibility, and risk, is about web compatibility.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will this change break things? Are we really, really sure? That is why we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; typically require every feature to have a finch flag so that at least
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Google Chrome can turn off something that causes unexpected problems.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; When I say &#38;quot;typical&#38;quot;, it&#39;s because no rule fits all, but then we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; instead need to know why a certain rule does not apply.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You will also see that we ask for some info texts, explainer,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specification, that many implementers consider obvious. Often it is not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; obvious for other people though, and these texts end up in official blog
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; posts and in other external communication.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Indeed, almost everything is N/A (I&#39;ve filled them out in the feature
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if you want to look).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The form seems fields seem to be mostly left empty. I don&#39;t think
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; anything should be empty (though a N/A may fit some things). I have
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; questions, but they would mostly be answered by filling in the form and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; re-posting it.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This very simple feature adds display-p3-linear as a CSS color space.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This has been added to the CSS specification and has a bazillion WPT tests
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; from:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It has been requested as a candidate for interop 2026:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; More relevant to the topics close to my heart are the fact that this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is a very good space for physically based rendering and high dynamic 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; range.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adding this space to the list of canvas spaces is a separate feature over

*Summary*
When an anchor-positioned element is tethered against an anchor that has a
transform (or is contained by something with a transform), resolve anchor()
and anchor-size() functions against the bounding box of the transformed
anchor.

*Motivation*
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-anchor-position-1/#anchor-position-size&#34;&#38;gt;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-anchor-position-1/#anchor-position-size&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; says
that transform effects on an anchor should affect the anchor box, so that
anchor-positioned elements may be positioned with regards to where an
anchor is on screen. This chimes well with how scroll offsets are also
taken into account. &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-anchor-position-1/#scroll&#34;&#38;gt;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-anchor-position-1/#scroll&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; This
behavior is crucial for creating sophisticated UI effects where elements
need to remain logically connected while one of them is being transformed.
Consider a tooltip that points to a button. If the button rotates or scales
on hover, you want the tooltip to move along with it, maintaining its
relative position.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Thanks for reviewing.

The mentioned issue was created in response to the initial explainer of 
ClipboardChange event API last year. Post this we had good discussions 
about the ClipboardChange event API in the working group meetings and 
arrived at an acceptable API signature and permission model for 
Safari/Firefox.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Although the current issue is not updated, I have just dropped a comment on 
this thread to close this.

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; The &#38;quot;clipboardchange&#38;quot; event fires whenever the system clipboard contents 
&#38;gt; are changed either by a web app or any other system application. This 
&#38;gt; allows web-apps like remote desktop clients to keep their clipboards 
&#38;gt; synchronized with the system clipboard. It provides an efficient 
&#38;gt; alternative to polling the clipboard(using Javascript) for changes.

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt; Today, a web-app can monitor the system clipboard by polling and reading 
&#38;gt; the clipboard through async clipboard API at regular intervals. For 
&#38;gt; example, web based remote desktop clients like Chrome Remote desktop may 
&#38;gt; read the clipboard contents for changes on every page focus event which is 
&#38;gt; inefficient. Some Github links also suggests polling of clipboard being 
&#38;gt; performed in Electron JS apps like (
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/LewdEwe-ErikWallace/d6e36f899a77a4f05e46388c254d014f&#34;&#38;gt;https://gist.github.com/LewdEwe-ErikWallace/d6e36f899a77a4f05e46388c254d014f&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;).
&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt; This feature aims to introduce an efficient way of notifying web apps when 
&#38;gt; clipboard changes.

&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt; To improve debuggability, developers should be able to set breakpoints 
&#38;gt; directly in their code where the clipboardchange event listener is 
&#38;gt; registered, using the Sources tool as with any other event. Additionally, 
&#38;gt; clipboardchange will be available alongside other clipboard-related 
&#38;gt; events—such as copy, cut, and paste—in the “Clipboard” section of Event 
&#38;gt; Listener Breakpoints within the Sources tool.

    *Specification*
    &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/clipboard-apis/pull/239&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/clipboard-apis/pull/239&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

    *Summary*
    The &#38;quot;clipboardchange&#38;quot; event fires whenever the system clipboard
    contents are changed either by a web app or any other system
    application. This allows web-apps like remote desktop clients
    to keep their clipboards synchronized with the system clipboard.
    It provides an efficient alternative to polling the
    clipboard(using Javascript) for changes.

    *Web Feature ID*
    clipboardchange &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://webstatus.dev/features/clipboardchange&#34;&#38;gt;https://webstatus.dev/features/clipboardchange&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

    *Motivation*
    Today, a web-app can monitor the system clipboard by polling and
    reading the clipboard through async clipboard API at regular
    intervals. For example, web based remote desktop clients like
    Chrome Remote desktop may read the clipboard contents for changes
    on every page focus event which is inefficient. Some Github links
    also suggests polling of clipboard being performed in Electron JS
    apps like
    
(&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/LewdEwe-ErikWallace/d6e36f899a77a4f05e46388c254d014f&#34;&#38;gt;https://gist.github.com/LewdEwe-ErikWallace/d6e36f899a77a4f05e46388c254d014f&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;).
    This feature aims to introduce an efficient way of notifying web
    apps when clipboard changes.

    *WebView application risks*

    Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs,
    such that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based
    applications?

    /No information provided/


    *Debuggability*
    To improve debuggability, developers should be able to set
    breakpoints directly in their code where the clipboardchange
    event listener is registered, using the Sources tool as with any
    other event. Additionally, clipboardchange will be available
    alongside other clipboard-related events—such as copy, cut, and
    paste—in the “Clipboard” section of Event Listener Breakpoints
    within the Sources tool.

    *Anticipated spec changes*

    Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web
    compat or interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to
    known github issues in the project for the feature specification)
    whose resolution may introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g.,
    changing to naming or structure of the API in a
    non-backward-compatible way).

Hi Alex,&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Google Meet needs this functionality. It gives WebRTC-based apps better 
control over video quality and performance. It has been reviewed and 
approved &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/2025/09/16-webrtc-minutes.html#cb3e&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/2025/09/16-webrtc-minutes.html#cb3e&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; by 
representatives of Mozilla, Meta, Apple and Microsoft at a WebRTC WG 
meeting. This is a small, incremental change that exposes an existing mode 
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/415200&#34;&#38;gt;https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/415200&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to JS.

Sergey

&#38;gt; Heya Sergey,
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; This seems like a great addition, but I&#39;m not sure why we&#39;re adding this 
&#38;gt; now? Are there any developers clamouring for it? Any sites that we know 
&#38;gt; will benefit?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; A short explainer that explains why this is an important problem to solve 
&#38;gt; would help me here, particularly that there are no signals and we&#39;re going 
&#38;gt; first, which raises the first-mover disadvantage risk.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Best,

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Specification*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/mst-content-hint/#dom-rtcdegradationpreference-maintain-framerate-and-resolution&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/mst-content-hint/#dom-rtcdegradationpreference-maintain-framerate-and-resolution&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;maintain-framerate-and-resolution&#38;quot; disables WebRTC&#39;s internal video 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; adaptation. This enables the application to implement its own adaptation 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; logic and prevents interference from the internal adaptation. From 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/mst-content-hint/#dom-rtcdegradationpreference-maintain-framerate-and-resolution:&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/mst-content-hint/#dom-rtcdegradationpreference-maintain-framerate-and-resolution:&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Maintain framerate and resolution regardless of video quality. The user 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; agent SHOULD NOT prefer reducing the framerate or resolution for quality 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and performance reasons, but MAY drop frames before encoding if necessary 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; not to overuse network and encoder resources.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebRTC has an internal video adaptation mechanism that optimizes video 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; quality and performance by adjusting encoding settings. This mechanism 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; relies on hardcoded logic and thresholds, which may not yield optimal 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; results across diverse use cases. Application may benefit from implementing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and using its own, external adaptation. For the external adaptation to work 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; properly, the internal one needs to be disabled. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;maintain-framerate-and-resolution&#38;quot; allows to disable the WebRTC&#39;s internal 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; adaptation. WebRTC WG presentation:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Low risk. This change adds &#38;quot;maintain-framerate-and-resolution&#38;quot; to the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RTCDegradationPreference enum. This new mode will not be used as a default

&#38;gt; Has this shipped in other browsers or could this still be fixed?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Specification*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adds a VideoFrame.metadata() method that returns a dictionary containing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the rtpTimestamp field, if the underlying VideoFrame has this field in its
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; native metadata. An empty dictionary is returned otherwise. Only video
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; frames originating from WebRTC sources will have the rtpTimestamp metadata
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; attached. Additional metadata fields are already present in the native
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation and may be exposed to JavaScript over time, as outlined in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the proposed spec:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Blink component*

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature exposes the rtpTimestamp field on the JavaScript facing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; VideoFrame.metadata dictionary when it is present in the underlying native
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; media::VideoFrameMetadata. It allows applications using
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; MediaStreamTrackProcessor (e.g., to render decoded WebRTC frames to a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; canvas) or WebCodecs (e.g., for custom decoding pipelines) to correlate
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; each exposed frame with its original RTP transport timestamp. This is
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; useful for: Media synchronization across tracks Jitter or latency
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; diagnostics Aligning decoded video with captured or received audio Spec

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The feature is additive and backward compatible. Existing WebCodecs and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebRTC APIs remain unchanged.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No known interop issues. WPT coverage validates expected behavior.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Firefox and WebKit positions are pending.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Gecko*: No signal (

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; None. This feature only exposes additional read only metadata
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (rtpTimestamp) on VideoFrame objects that are already surfaced through
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebCodecs and WebRTC pipelines. No changes to existing Android WebView
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; behavior or APIs. Safe for WebView.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No impact to DevTools workflows. Feature testing is via JS API inspection
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and WPT automation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; VideoFrame metadata inspection (including rtpTimestamp) can be done via
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Javascript using MediaStreamTrackProcessor and WebCodecs/WebRTC or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; automated via WebDriver BiDi tests.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by **web-platform-tests

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; --enable-blink-features=VideoFrameMetadataRtpTimestamp
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Finch feature name*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; None. Rollout is via milestone 146 stable. No finch experiment planned.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-finch justification*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The feature is additive and backward compatible. Existing WebCodecs and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebRTC APIs remain unchanged.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Rollout plan*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will ship enabled for all users
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Requires code in //chrome?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; False
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Available by default in Chrome 146 for all desktop platforms. Mobile
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; availability (Android) expected to follow in the same milestone.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Expected to be adopted by WebRTC and streaming applications that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; correlate decoded VideoFrame metadata with RTP timestamps for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; synchronization and telemetry. This includes browser based streaming
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; clients that use MediaStreamTrackProcessor.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption plan*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Ship enabled by default for all users in Chrome 146. Coordinate with
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers via WPT test results and the published ChromeStatus entry. No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developer facing migration required.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; None. The feature is implemented entirely within Chromium’s open source
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; stack (WebRTC, Blink, and WebCodecs)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Estimated milestones*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Shipping on desktop
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 146
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Shipping on Android
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 146
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Shipping on WebView
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 146
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Anticipated spec changes*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; None expected. This feature implements the rtpTimestamp entry in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebCodecs VideoFrame Metadata Registry and matches the current registry
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; text (name, type, and semantics). The registry status is “W3C Draft
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Registry,” but any further edits we expect to be editorial or additive. If
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a normative change were proposed (e.g., semantics/units&#39; clarification or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; constraints), we would align Chromium accordingly and update tests.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Specification*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/webcodecs-video-frame-metadata-registry/#dom-videoframemetadata&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adds a VideoFrame.metadata() method that returns a dictionary containing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the rtpTimestamp field, if the underlying VideoFrame has this field in its
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; native metadata. An empty dictionary is returned otherwise. Only video
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; frames originating from WebRTC sources will have the rtpTimestamp metadata
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; attached. Additional metadata fields are already present in the native
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation and may be exposed to JavaScript over time, as outlined in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the proposed spec:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature exposes the rtpTimestamp field on the JavaScript facing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; VideoFrame.metadata dictionary when it is present in the underlying native
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; media::VideoFrameMetadata. It allows applications using
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; MediaStreamTrackProcessor (e.g., to render decoded WebRTC frames to a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; canvas) or WebCodecs (e.g., for custom decoding pipelines) to correlate
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; each exposed frame with its original RTP transport timestamp. This is
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; useful for: Media synchronization across tracks Jitter or latency

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebRTC APIs remain unchanged.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No known interop issues. WPT coverage validates expected behavior.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; None. This feature only exposes additional read only metadata
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (rtpTimestamp) on VideoFrame objects that are already surfaced through
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebCodecs and WebRTC pipelines. No changes to existing Android WebView
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; behavior or APIs. Safe for WebView.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No impact to DevTools workflows. Feature testing is via JS API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; inspection and WPT automation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; VideoFrame metadata inspection (including rtpTimestamp) can be done via
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Javascript using MediaStreamTrackProcessor and WebCodecs/WebRTC or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; automated via WebDriver BiDi tests.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Finch feature name*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; None. Rollout is via milestone 146 stable. No finch experiment planned.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-finch justification*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The feature is additive and backward compatible. Existing WebCodecs and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebRTC APIs remain unchanged.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Rollout plan*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will ship enabled for all users
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Requires code in //chrome?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; False
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Availability expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Available by default in Chrome 146 for all desktop platforms. Mobile
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; availability (Android) expected to follow in the same milestone.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Expected to be adopted by WebRTC and streaming applications that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; correlate decoded VideoFrame metadata with RTP timestamps for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; synchronization and telemetry. This includes browser based streaming
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; clients that use MediaStreamTrackProcessor.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption plan*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Ship enabled by default for all users in Chrome 146. Coordinate with
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers via WPT test results and the published ChromeStatus entry. No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developer facing migration required.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Non-OSS dependencies*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; None. The feature is implemented entirely within Chromium’s open source
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; stack (WebRTC, Blink, and WebCodecs)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Estimated milestones*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Shipping on desktop
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 146
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Shipping on Android
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 146
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Shipping on WebView
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 146
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Anticipated spec changes*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; None expected. This feature implements the rtpTimestamp entry in the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebCodecs VideoFrame Metadata Registry and matches the current registry
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; text (name, type, and semantics). The registry status is “W3C Draft
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Registry,” but any further edits we expect to be editorial or additive. If
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a normative change were proposed (e.g., semantics/units&#39; clarification or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; constraints), we would align Chromium accordingly and update tests.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hey, yes you will need a separate chromestatus entry for the removal
(enforcement phase).&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

LGTM1 for the new location of the parameter, new error name, and
deprecating old location of the parameter and old error name (everything up
to and including the warning phase)

Thanks,
Vlad

&#38;gt; Ok, sounds good. Requesting lgtms for the warning phase then. Will we need
&#38;gt; a separate chromestatus later to request approval for the enforcement phase?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes, that would be the plan. This intent when approved would cover both
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; new nonce parameter and the error rename up to and including the &#38;quot;warning
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; phase&#38;quot;. A separate intent will be required for the &#38;quot;enforcement phase&#38;quot; (one
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; intent for both error rename and nonce parameter).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; To clarify, are we approved for what we called the warning phase for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; both the nonce parameter and the error rename? Then, we&#39;d send a separate
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; intent for the enforcement phase for both of these, with data showing usage
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; drop. Is that correct?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We discussed this at API owners:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The general sense is that this intent may be doing too many things.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re happy to approve this intent as shipping the new location for the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; parameter and deprecating the old location (with a warning).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; However, we also believe that the removal (in Chrome 145) has to be a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; separate intent to remove requiring separate approvals. For the removal, we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; would want to see stats to see that the usage is dropping due to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; deprecation low enough that the risk of removal is acceptable.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does that sound like a reasonable path forward?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Responding for Suresh since he&#39;s OOO this week. For breakage, we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; already have UKM metrics for any UI breakage (the error API usage from the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; IDP side may cause the UI to look differently when some error occurs). I
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; noticed we don&#39;t have metrics on the JS getter side, so we will add those
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; since the RP side can also break with this change. We plan to have 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; outreach
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; publicly through our devrel channels and also talking to the few IDPs that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; use the error API. Since FedCM use mainly happens through SDKs, we&#39;re
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; confident that the combination of public announcement plus IDP outreach
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will sufficiently mitigate the breakage, even if we find that today the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; number of sites using this is currently high.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Summary
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Migration of nonce to params Field: The nonce parameter in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; navigator.credentials.get() is moving from a top-level field to the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; params
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; object for better API design, extensibility, and maintainability. This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; structured approach simplifies parsing for Identity Providers, supports
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; future-proofing without versioning, and aligns with modern API patterns.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; For Relying Parties, the impact is minimal—they provide the same nonce
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; value in a new location. Migration Plan Chrome will enforce this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rule in two phases: Chrome 143 (Warning Phase): nonce accepted both
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; at top level and inside params. Top-level usage triggers a console 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; warning. Chrome
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 145 (Enforcement Phase): Top-level nonce removed; must be passed
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; within params. Rename code to error in IdentityCredentialError: The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; code attribute in IdentityCredentialError is renamed to error for clearer
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; semantics, better developer experience, and alignment with web standards.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This change reduces ambiguity and avoids conflicts with 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; DOMException.code.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Additionally, error.code becomes error.error, retaining its DOMString 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; type. Migration
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Plan Chrome will enforce this rule in two phases: Chrome 143
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (Warning Phase): Both error and code attributes are supported. Using
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; code triggers a console warning, guiding developers to migrate. Chrome
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 145 (Enforcement Phase): Attribute code will be removed, only
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; attribute error remains. Update code before this version to prevent
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; breakage. Blink component

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome 143 allows old and new patterns with warnings. By Chrome 145,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; top-level nonce and code attributes are removed, requiring params for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; nonce
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and error for IdentityCredentialError. Failure to migrate breaks
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authentication and error handling, runtime issues, and degraded user
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; experience.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; breakage sounds pretty high - do we have a sense of how many sites will 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; affected, etc?

Specification
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://drafts.csswg.org/web-animations-2&#34;&#38;gt;https://drafts.csswg.org/web-animations-2&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;


Summary
The iterationComposite property controls how successive iterations of a CSS 
animation combine with each other, allowing developers to specify whether each 
successive iteration is calculated independently (&#38;quot;replace&#38;quot;) or is accumulated 
with the final value of the previous iteration (&#38;quot;accumulate&#38;quot;).


Blink component
Blink&#38;gt;Animation


Web Feature ID
api.KeyframeEffect.iterationComposite


Motivation
The `iterationComposite` property specifies whether each animation iteration 
starts fresh (&#38;quot;replace&#38;quot;) or builds upon the previous one (&#38;quot;accumulate&#38;quot;), 
enabling a wider range of progressive animations using declarative syntax 
instead of manual value tracking. This property complements others in the Web 
Animations API which are already implemented in Chromium, particularly 
`composite` which controls how simultaneous animations combine.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;The PR is nearly finalized. All major issues about privacy and event 
changeID have been resolved after team discussion. Awaiting final signoffs 
and possible WG discussion (that&#39;s why the Agenda+ label) before merging. There 
are no blocking problems left as of now.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The mentioned issue was created in response to the initial explainer of 
&#38;gt; ClipboardChange event API last year. Post this we had good discussions 
&#38;gt; about the ClipboardChange event API in the working group meetings and 
&#38;gt; arrived at an acceptable API signature and permission model for 
&#38;gt; Safari/Firefox.

&#38;gt; Can you summarize where you are with the PR? I see some activity over the 
&#38;gt; past few weeks, and an Agenda+ label. 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Although the current issue is not updated, I have just dropped a comment 
&#38;gt; on this thread to close this.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Thanks. I left a pointer to that in the Mozilla standards position thread (

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The &#38;quot;clipboardchange&#38;quot; event fires whenever the system clipboard contents 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; are changed either by a web app or any other system application. This 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; allows web-apps like remote desktop clients to keep their clipboards 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; synchronized with the system clipboard. It provides an efficient 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; alternative to polling the clipboard(using Javascript) for changes.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Today, a web-app can monitor the system clipboard by polling and reading 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the clipboard through async clipboard API at regular intervals. For 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; example, web based remote desktop clients like Chrome Remote desktop may 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; read the clipboard contents for changes on every page focus event which is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; inefficient. Some Github links also suggests polling of clipboard being 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; performed in Electron JS apps like (
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/LewdEwe-ErikWallace/d6e36f899a77a4f05e46388c254d014f&#34;&#38;gt;https://gist.github.com/LewdEwe-ErikWallace/d6e36f899a77a4f05e46388c254d014f&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature aims to introduce an efficient way of notifying web apps when 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; clipboard changes.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; To improve debuggability, developers should be able to set breakpoints 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; directly in their code where the clipboardchange event listener is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; registered, using the Sources tool as with any other event. Additionally, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; clipboardchange will be available alongside other clipboard-related 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; events—such as copy, cut, and paste—in the “Clipboard” section of Event 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Listener Breakpoints within the Sources tool.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

*Summary*
Support of `text-justify` CSS property Web authors can control how text is
justified when `text-align: justify` is applied by using the `text-justify`
property. For example, they can force justification by expanding
inter-character space even in English text.

There are also canvas gradient WPT tests (which is a feature that hasn&#39;t
made it into the spec yet). I&#39;ve updated the tests and our (speculative)
implementation to include display-p3-linear.

&#38;gt; Good catch, gradients in linear color space is a very plausible use case
&#38;gt; that we should test. Chris, can you add a test for this? I presume there
&#38;gt; are other tests that can be copied.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It appears the new color space in WPT still lacks testing for CSS
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; gradients. Could this be added?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; e.g.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `background-image: linear-gradient(to right in display-p3-linear, red,

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lists most of the things we want to know before sending a feature out into
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the wild wild world.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; One of the main questions regards compatibility. We want what we do to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; end up in a web where browsers agree on how something should be rendered
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which is why we typically require new features to probe Mozilla and WebKit
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; through their web standards positions (unless they have already shipped).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Another aspect of compatibility, and risk, is about web compatibility.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will this change break things? Are we really, really sure? That is why we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; typically require every feature to have a finch flag so that at least
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Google Chrome can turn off something that causes unexpected problems.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; When I say &#38;quot;typical&#38;quot;, it&#39;s because no rule fits all, but then we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; instead need to know why a certain rule does not apply.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You will also see that we ask for some info texts, explainer,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specification, that many implementers consider obvious. Often it is not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; obvious for other people though, and these texts end up in official blog
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; posts and in other external communication.

&#38;gt; I&#39;ve updated the CSS gradient tests for this here:

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; There are also canvas gradient WPT tests (which is a feature that hasn&#39;t
&#38;gt; made it into the spec yet). I&#39;ve updated the tests and our (speculative)
&#38;gt; implementation to include display-p3-linear.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Good catch, gradients in linear color space is a very plausible use case
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that we should test. Chris, can you add a test for this? I presume there

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It appears the new color space in WPT still lacks testing for CSS
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; gradients. Could this be added?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; e.g.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `background-image: linear-gradient(to right in display-p3-linear, red,

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; link to the spec, and a standards position for Mozilla was filed:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This already landed in WebKit:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (the failure of display-p3-linear-006.html is only off by 1 for a bunch of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; pixels)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; So I think this is quite a straightforward case, LGTM1!

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lists most of the things we want to know before sending a feature out 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; into
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the wild wild world.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; One of the main questions regards compatibility. We want what we do
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to end up in a web where browsers agree on how something should be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rendered
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which is why we typically require new features to probe Mozilla and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebKit
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; through their web standards positions (unless they have already shipped).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Another aspect of compatibility, and risk, is about web
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compatibility. Will this change break things? Are we really, really sure?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; That is why we typically require every feature to have a finch flag so 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; at least Google Chrome can turn off something that causes unexpected
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; problems.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; When I say &#38;quot;typical&#38;quot;, it&#39;s because no rule fits all, but then we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; instead need to know why a certain rule does not apply.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You will also see that we ask for some info texts, explainer,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specification, that many implementers consider obvious. Often it is not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; obvious for other people though, and these texts end up in official blog
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; posts and in other external communication.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; More relevant to the topics close to my heart are the fact that this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is a very good space for physically based rendering and high dynamic 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; range.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adding this space to the list of canvas spaces is a separate feature

Specification

Summary
On mobile, &#38;quot;eager&#38;quot; eagerness speculation rules prefetches and prerenders now 
trigger when HTML anchor elements are in the viewport for a short time. The 
previous behavior, of starting prefetch/prerenders as soon as possible, was the 
same as &#38;quot;immediate&#38;quot; eagerness. This new behavior is more useful as it better 
reflects the author&#39;s intent to be more eager than the &#38;quot;moderate&#38;quot; and less 
eager than &#38;quot;immediate&#38;quot;. More detail on this and other upcoming improvements to 
speculation rules eagerness are available at 
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPbtUPfZIDElzBZNx8IQMzRFvy8oauLG_i1XIr6jgTs/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&#38;gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPbtUPfZIDElzBZNx8IQMzRFvy8oauLG_i1XIr6jgTs/edit?usp=sharing&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;.

Risks




Interoperability and Compatibility
The exact definitions of eagerness levels are left vague in the specification. 
(&#38;quot;User agents should enact the candidate if user behavior suggests the user may 
navigate to this URL in the near future. For instance, the user might have 
scrolled a link into the viewport and moved the cursor over it for some time.&#38;quot;) 
This change is in line with those suggestions. Due to speculation rules&#39; nature 
as a progressive enhancement, it is very hard to depend on the exact heuristic, 
so varying across browser engines, platforms, and browser versions should not 
pose significant interoperability or compatibility risks. As evidence, the 
heuristic has varied across mobile and desktop ever since launch, and this has 
not caused such problems.

Gecko: Neutral 
(&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/620#issuecomment-2546739520&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/620#issuecomment-2546739520&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
 We have not asked Firefox for their thoughts on this specific change. They are 
positive on and implementing prefetching, and will likely make their own 
choices for how to implement each eagerness level.

WebKit: No signal (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/54&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/54&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) 
We&#39;ve not asked Safari for their thoughts on this specific change. They have 
recently indicated a tentative positive position towards conservative-eagerness 
prefetching.

Web developers: Positive We&#39;ve seen several developers re-create this 
viewport-based technique using JavaScript to manually insert and remove 
speculation rules, eg in the Quicklink library.

Other signals:


WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
No information provided



Debuggability
No information provided


Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
No
This is only applicable to mobile, and desktop already has another heuristic.


Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?
No
Because the specification intentionally allows user agent flexibility, web 
platform tests do not capture any specific heuristic here.

    Ok, sounds good. Requesting lgtms for the warning phase then. Will
    we need a separate chromestatus later to request approval for the
    enforcement phase?

        Yes, that would be the plan. This intent when approved would
        cover both new nonce parameter and the error rename up to and
        including the &#38;quot;warning phase&#38;quot;. A separate intent will be
        required for the &#38;quot;enforcement phase&#38;quot; (one intent for both
        error rename and nonce parameter).

            To clarify, are we approved for what we called the warning
            phase for both the nonce parameter and the error rename?
            Then, we&#39;d send a separate intent for the enforcement
            phase for both of these, with data showing usage drop. Is
            that correct?

                We discussed this at API owners:

                The general sense is that this intent may be doing too
                many things.

                We&#39;re happy to approve this intent as shipping the new
                location for the parameter and deprecating the old
                location (with a warning).

                However, we also believe that the removal (in Chrome
                145) has to be a separate intent to remove requiring
                separate approvals. For the removal, we would want to
                see stats to see that the usage is dropping due to
                deprecation low enough that the risk of removal is
                acceptable.

                Does that sound like a reasonable path forward?

                    For breakage, we already have UKM metrics for any
                    UI breakage (the error API usage from the IDP side
                    may cause the UI to look differently when some
                    error occurs). I noticed we don&#39;t have metrics on
                    the JS getter side, so we will add those since the
                    RP side can also break with this change. We plan
                    to have outreach publicly through our devrel
                    channels and also talking to the few IDPs that use
                    the error API. Since FedCM use mainly happens
                    through SDKs, we&#39;re confident that the combination
                    of public announcement plus IDP outreach will
                    sufficiently mitigate the breakage, even if we
                    find that today the number of sites using this is
                    currently high.

                        Summary

                        Migration of nonce to params Field:The nonce
                        parameter in navigator.credentials.get() is
                        moving from a top-level field to the params
                        object for better API design, extensibility,
                        and maintainability. This structured approach
                        simplifies parsing for Identity Providers,
                        supports future-proofing without versioning,
                        and aligns with modern API patterns. For
                        Relying Parties, the impact is minimal—they
                        provide the same nonce value in a new
                        location.Migration PlanChrome will enforce
                        this rule in two phases:Chrome 143 (Warning
                        Phase):nonce accepted both at top level and
                        inside params. Top-level usage triggers a
                        console warning.Chrome 145 (Enforcement
                        Phase):Top-level nonce removed; must be
                        passed within params.Rename code to error in
                        IdentityCredentialError:The code attribute in
                        IdentityCredentialError is renamed to error
                        for clearer semantics, better developer
                        experience, and alignment with web standards.
                        This change reduces ambiguity and avoids
                        conflicts with DOMException.code.
                        Additionally, error.code becomes error.error,
                        retaining its DOMString type.Migration
                        PlanChrome will enforce this rule in two
                        phases:Chrome 143 (Warning Phase):Both error
                        and code attributes are supported. Using code
                        triggers a console warning, guiding
                        developers to migrate.Chrome 145 (Enforcement
                        Phase): Attribute code will be removed, only

                        Interoperability and Compatibility

                        Chrome 143 allows old and new patterns with
                        warnings. By Chrome 145, top-level nonce and
                        code attributes are removed, requiring params
                        for nonce and error for
                        IdentityCredentialError. Failure to migrate
                        breaks authentication and error handling,
                        runtime issues, and degraded user experience.

    I&#39;ve updated the CSS gradient tests for this here:
    &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7077316&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7077316&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

    There are also canvas gradient WPT tests (which is a feature that
    hasn&#39;t made it into the spec yet). I&#39;ve updated the tests and our
    (speculative) implementation to include display-p3-linear.

        Good catch, gradients in linear color space is a very
        plausible use case that we should test. Chris, can you add a
        test for this? I presume there are other tests that can be copied.

            It appears the new color space in WPT still lacks testing
            for CSS gradients. Could this be added?

            e.g.

            `background-image: linear-gradient(to right in

                        lists most of the things we want to know
                        before sending a feature out into the wild
                        wild world.

                        One of the main questions regards
                        compatibility. We want what we do to end up in
                        a web where browsers agree on how something
                        should be rendered which is why we typically
                        require new features to probe Mozilla and
                        WebKit through their web standards positions
                        (unless they have already shipped).

                        Another aspect of compatibility, and risk, is
                        about web compatibility. Will this change
                        break things? Are we really, really sure? That
                        is why we typically require every feature to
                        have a finch flag so that at least Google
                        Chrome can turn off something that causes
                        unexpected problems.

                        When I say &#38;quot;typical&#38;quot;, it&#39;s because no rule
                        fits all, but then we instead need to know why
                        a certain rule does not apply.

                        You will also see that we ask for some info
                        texts, explainer, specification, that many
                        implementers consider obvious. Often it is not
                        obvious for other people though, and these
                        texts end up in official blog posts and in
                        other external communication.

&#38;gt; These are just event handler attributes, but for larger Gamepad API 
&#38;gt; changes it would indeed to be nice to consider device mocking for testing. 
&#38;gt; I think something like this for Bluetooth might be a pattern to follow:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would be nice to have testdriver.js automation for this (instead of just 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that the attribute exists), but seems small enough that I&#39;m OK not blocking 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; on this.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Add ongamepadconnected and ongamepaddisconnected event handlers to the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WindowEventHandlers interface mixin. This would enable support for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; window.ongamepad[dis]connected or document.body.ongamepad[dis]connected 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; event handler attributes. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Blink component*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Blink&#38;gt;GamepadAPI 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1222907:%22Blink%3EGamepadAPI%22&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1222907:%22Blink%3EGamepadAPI%22&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Web Feature ID*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; gamepad &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://webstatus.dev/features/gamepad&#34;&#38;gt;https://webstatus.dev/features/gamepad&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The gamepad[dis]connected events can be subscribed to using 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; window.addEventListener() currently. This adds the ability to use 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; window.ongamepad[dis]connected event handler attributes as well.

Summary

XSLT v1.0, which all browsers adhere to, was standardized in 1999. In the
meantime, XSLT has evolved to v2.0 and v3.0, adding features, and growing
apart from the old version frozen into browsers. This lack of advancement,
coupled with the rise of JavaScript libraries and frameworks that offer
more flexible and powerful DOM manipulation, has led to a significant
decline in the use of client-side XSLT. Its role within the web browser has
been largely superseded by JavaScript-based technologies such as JSON+React.

Chromium uses the libxslt library to process these transformations, and libxslt
was unmaintained
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://discourse.gnome.org/t/stepping-down-as-libxslt-maintainer/27615&#34;&#38;gt;https://discourse.gnome.org/t/stepping-down-as-libxslt-maintainer/27615&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
for ~6 months of 2025. Libxslt is a complex, aging C codebase of the type
notoriously susceptible to memory safety vulnerabilities like buffer
overflows, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. Because client-side
XSLT is now a niche, rarely-used feature, these libraries receive far less
maintenance and security scrutiny than core JavaScript engines, yet they
represent a direct, potent attack surface for processing untrusted web
content. Indeed, XSLT is the source of several recent high-profile security
exploits that continue to put browser users at risk.

For these reasons, Chromium would like to deprecate and remove XSLT. WHATWG
decided to move XSLT deprecation to stage 3

Both other browser engines are also planning to deprecate XSLT. The
proposed timeline for Chromium is to deprecate in M143, remove in M155
(except for Origin Trial and Enterprise Policy users), and discontinue the
Origin Trial and Enterprise Policy in M164. See below for more details.

Motivation

Security risks for all users outweigh the very small usage of this feature
on the open web.

Usage of the JS XSLTProcessor API
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/79&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/79&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is fairly
volatile, registering somewhere between 0.01% and 0.1% of page loads,
averaging around 0.05% over time. These numbers are above the typical
0.001% deprecation threshold. Again, we feel that the increased potential
for breakage is balanced by the reduced security risk to 100% of Chromium
users. And we are doing everything we can to mitigate this breakage and be
proactive in reaching out to potentially affected sites and particularly
libraries that might account for significant chunks of the overall usage.
In addition, several sites we surveyed that use XSLTProcessor have feature
detection code with fallbacks to JS libraries like Saxonica. Of the ~220
sites we&#39;ve surveyed so far, roughly 72% of them are still functional even
with XSLT disabled.

The usage of declarative XSL Processing Instructions
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/78&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/78&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is
significantly lower, around 0.001% for the last few years. This is at or
below the safe deprecation threshold.

Risks


Interoperability and Compatibility

Removal of this feature constitutes a compat risk, since sites that use
XSLT may stop working when the feature is removed. Mitigations include a
very long deprecation window, a polyfill, lots of outreach, and both origin
trials and enterprise policies to allow sites even more time to migrate.

The polyfill &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mfreed7/xslt_polyfill&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mfreed7/xslt_polyfill&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is specifically
built to mimic the existing behavior of Chrome as closely as possible. In
most cases, it is a single-line drop-in fix for a lack of XSLT in the
browser. According to my analysis, about 75% of sites that hit the use
counter don&#39;t appear to be visibly broken. Of the 25% that do appear broken
in some way (e.g. some components not rendering, or raw XML output instead
of transformed HTML), 82% have their functionality restored by the addition
of the single-line polyfill. Of the 18% that can&#39;t use the polyfill, the
primary reason seems to be CORS restrictions, as detailed
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mfreed7/xslt_polyfill/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#limitations&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mfreed7/xslt_polyfill/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#limitations&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
in the polyfill documentation. And even if site owners take no action,
individual users can install the browser extension
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mfreed7/xslt_extension&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mfreed7/xslt_extension&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;, which uses the polyfill, to
get back full functionality.

Existing users of XSLT are understandably negative on this removal, and
have been very vocal about it on the standards issue and elsewhere. There
are also mixed/positive reactions from some folks in the public
discussions, many of whose participants seem to agree with the removal of
XSLT from browsers. But the average/overall developer opinion (as measured
by comments on public threads) is negative.

Other signals:

Activation

See above - the polyfill and extension will ease the migration burden.

Security

This removal constitutes a big win for security, in that it removes a
highly-vulnerable external library from Chromium.

WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

In the same way that this poses a compat risk on the open web, it poses a
risk for WebView applications.


Deprecation/Removal Plan

The tentative deprecation/removal plan would be as follows:

- M142 (Oct 28, 2025): Early warning console messages added to Chrome.

- M143 (Dec 2, 2025): Official deprecation of the API - deprecation warning
messages begin to show in the console and in lighthouse.

- M148 (March 10, 2026 Canary): Canary, Dev, and Beta releases begin
disabling XSLT by default, as an early-warning.

- M152 (Aug 25, 2026): Origin Trial and Enterprise Policy go live for
testing. These allow sites and enterprises to continue using features past
the removal date.

- M155 (Nov 17, 2026): XSLT stops functioning on Stable releases, for all
users other than Origin Trial and Enterprise Policy participants.

- M164 (Aug 17, 2027): Origin Trial and Enterprise Policy stop functioning.
XSLT is disabled for all users.

&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;As far as the process goes, resource owners need to actively assert

    Sorry, I missed a step in making the candidate resource list
    public. I have moved it to my chromium account and made it public
    here
    
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgWhdeqKbGm6hLM9WqnnXLn-iiO4Y9HTjDXjVO2aBqI/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&#38;gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgWhdeqKbGm6hLM9WqnnXLn-iiO4Y9HTjDXjVO2aBqI/edit?usp=sharing&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.


    Not everything in that list meets all of the criteria - it&#39;s just
    the first step in the manual curation (same URL served the same
    content across &#38;gt; 20k sites in the HTTP Archive dataset).

    The manual steps frome there for meeting the criteria are basically:

    - Cull the list for scripts, stylesheets and compression
    dictionaries.
    - Remove any URLs that use query parameters.
    - Exclude any responses that set cookies.
    - Identify URLs that are not manually versioned by site embedders
    (i.e. the embedded resource can not get stale). This is either
    in-place updating resources or automatically versioned resources.
    - Only include URLs that can reliably target a single resource by
    pattern (i.e. ..../&#38;lt;hash&#38;gt;-common.js but not ..../&#38;lt;hash&#38;gt;.js)
    - Get confirmation from the resource owner that the given URL
    Pattern is and will continue to be appropriate for the
    single-keyed cache
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/blockquote&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

    A few questions on list curation:

    Can you clarify how big the list will be? The privacy review at
    &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5202380930678784?gate=5174931459145728 &#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5202380930678784?gate=5174931459145728 &#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
mentions
    ~500, while the design doc mentions 1000. I see the candidate
    resource list starts at ~5000, then presumably manual curation
    begins to get to one of those numbers.

    What is the expected list curation/update cadence? Is it actually
    manual?

    Is there any recourse process for owners of resources that don&#39;t
    want to be included? Do we have documentation on what it mean to
    be appropriate for the single-keyed cache?

    thanks,
    Mike

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;I don&#39;t believe the security/privacy protections actually rely on the
assertions (and it&#39;s unlikely those would be public). It&#39;s more for
awareness and to make sure they don&#39;t accidentally break something with
their app if they were relying on the responses being partitioned by site.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

As far as query params go, the browser code already only filters for
requests with no query params so any that do rely on query params won&#39;t get
included anyway.

The same goes for cookies. Since the feature is only enabled when
third-party cookies are enabled, adding cookies to these responses or
putting unique content in them won&#39;t actually pierce any new boundaries but
it goes against the intent of only using it for public/static resources and
they&#39;d lose the benefit of the shared cache when it gets updated. Same goes
for the fingerprinting risks if the pattern was abused.

&#38;gt; The candidate list goes down to 20k occurrences in order to catch

&#38;gt; different hashes that add up to 100k+ occurrences. In the candidate list,
&#38;gt; without any filtering, the 100k cutoff is around 600, I&#39;d estimate that
&#38;gt; well less than 25% of the candidates make it through the filtering for
&#38;gt; stable pattern, correct resource type and reliable pattern. First release
&#38;gt; will likely be 100-200 and I don&#39;t expect it will ever grow above 500.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Thanks - I see the living document has been updated to mention 500 as a
&#38;gt; ceiling.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; As far as cadence goes, I expect there will be a lot of activity for the
&#38;gt; next few releases as individual patterns are coordinated with the origin
&#38;gt; owners but then it will settle down to a much more bursty pattern of
&#38;gt; updates every few Chrome releases (likely linked with an origin changing
&#38;gt; their application and adding more/different resources). And yes, it is
&#38;gt; manual.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; As far as the process goes, resource owners need to actively assert that
&#38;gt; their resource is appropriate for the single-keyed cache and that they
&#38;gt; would like it included (usually in response to active outreach from us but
&#38;gt; we have the external-facing list for owner-initiated contact as well).  The
&#38;gt; design doc has the documentation for what it means to be appropriate (and
&#38;gt; the doc will be moved to a readme page in the repository next to the actual
&#38;gt; list so it&#39;s not a hard-to-find Google doc):
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Will there be any kind of public record of this assertion? What happens if
&#38;gt; a site starts using query params or sending cookies? Does the person in
&#38;gt; charge of manual list curation discover that in the next release? Does that
&#38;gt; require a new release (I don&#39;t know if this lives in component updater, or
&#38;gt; in the binary itself)?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; 5. Require resource owner opt-in
&#38;gt; For each URL to be included, reach out to the team/company responsible for
&#38;gt; the resource to validate the URL pattern and get assurances that the
&#38;gt; pattern will always serve the same content to all sites and not be abused
&#38;gt; for tracking (by using unique URLs within the pattern mask as a bit-mask
&#38;gt; for fingerprinting). They will also need to validate that the URLs covered
&#38;gt; by the pattern will not rely on being able to set cookies over HTTP using a
&#38;gt; Set-Cookie HTTP response header because they will not be re-applied
&#38;gt; across cache boundaries (the set-cookie is not cached with the resource).

Platforms

ChromeOS 
Other desktop platforms(Windows, Mac Linux) when managed Isolated Web Apps 
are launched on those.

Summary

Starting in Chrome 143, only Isolated Web Apps (IWAs) that are on a 
Google-managed allowlist can be installed or updated via administrator 
policies. This change affects all managed scenarios, including Managed User 
Sessions, Managed Guest Sessions, and Kiosk mode. The change does not 
affect developer-mode installations.

This allowlisting process is being implemented to enhance platform security 
and stability. It ensures that IWA developers adhere to Google&#39;s platform 
policies and establishes a verified contact with them. This direct contact 
is critical for addressing emergency cases, such as a security 
vulnerability or a major application defect.

*Impact*
New Installations &#38;amp; Updates:The method for installing IWAs remains the 
same. However, any new installation or update will fail if the 
application&#39;s ID is not on the Google-managed allowlist.
Existing Installations: IWAs already installed on user devices will remain, 
but they will no longer receive updates until they are allowlisted.

*Blink components*
No Blink component

*Chrome components*

Summary
Functionality added to the WebGPU spec after its first shipment in a browser. 
Uniform buffers declared in WGSL shaders are no longer required to have 16-byte 
alignment on array elements, or to pad nested structure offsets to a multiple 
of 16 bytes.


Blink component

Web Feature ID
webgpu


Motivation
This feature simplifies the use of uniform buffers in WGSL shaders by unifying 
their constraints with those of storage buffers. Without this, developers are 
required to align all array elements to 16 bytes and pad nested structures to 
achieve a 16-byte offset.

WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
None



Debuggability
None


Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?
Yes
All platforms will eventually have support. Will immediately be available on 
Android, Android WebView, ChromeOS, Mac, and Windows, since those platforms 
already support WebGPU. Linux is planned to have WebGPU support in the future, 
so this feature will become available when WebGPU does.


Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?
Yes
WebGPU/WGSL have a conformance test suite (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/gpuweb/cts&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/gpuweb/cts&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) that 
is regularly pulled into Chromium and part of the testing of Dawn/Tint in 
Chromium. While the CTS can be embedded in WPT, the WebGPU team opted to keep 
it separate in Chromium testing to use a customized harness for robustness and 
performance. CTS coverage for this feature was added here:

Anticipated spec changes

Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or interop 
issues. Please list open issues (eg links to known github issues in the project 
for the feature specification) whose resolution may introduce web 
compat/interop risk (eg, changing to naming or structure of the API in a 
non-backward-compatible way).

Summary
Enables percentage values for the letter-spacing and word-spacing CSS property, 
as defined in the CSS Text Module Level 4 spec. Percentage values are 
calculated relative to the advance measure of the space character (U+0020). 
This gives developers more robust and flexible control over typography, 
particularly in responsive designs where text spacing needs to adapt to 
different viewports and font sizes.

Risks




Interoperability and Compatibility
Risks are low. This is a support for new value of CSS properties. So sites not 
using properties won&#39;t be affected. Firefox and Safari has supported this 
feature for years.

&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that 
&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications? 
&#38;gt; None 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt; None 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, 
&#38;gt; Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt; Yes 
&#38;gt; All platforms will eventually have support. Will immediately be available 
&#38;gt; on Android, Android WebView, ChromeOS, Mac, and Windows, since those 
&#38;gt; platforms already support WebGPU. Linux is planned to have WebGPU support 
&#38;gt; in the future, so this feature will become available when WebGPU does. 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests

&#38;gt; Yes 
&#38;gt; WebGPU/WGSL have a conformance test suite (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/gpuweb/cts&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/gpuweb/cts&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;) 
&#38;gt; that is regularly pulled into Chromium and part of the testing of Dawn/Tint 
&#38;gt; in Chromium. While the CTS can be embedded in WPT, the WebGPU team opted to 
&#38;gt; keep it separate in Chromium testing to use a customized harness for 
&#38;gt; robustness and performance. CTS coverage for this feature was added here:

&#38;gt; *Anticipated spec changes*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or 
&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues 
&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may 
&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of 
&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;other relevant spec reference, can we include that in the Intent to Ship?

*Summary*
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Enables percentage values for the letter-spacing and word-spacing CSS 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;property, as defined in the CSS Text Module Level 4 spec. Percentage 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;values are calculated relative to the advance measure of the space 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;character (U+0020). This gives developers more robust and flexible 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;control over typography, particularly in responsive designs where text 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;spacing needs to adapt to different viewports and font sizes.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

*Risks*


*Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Risks are low. This is a support for new value of CSS properties. So 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;sites not using properties won&#39;t be affected. Firefox and Safari has 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;supported this feature for years.

&#38;gt; What I would suggest is to test the current behavior and make any changes 
&#38;gt; you think are necessary for a good user experience, to report that on the 
&#38;gt; issue and then ship.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; FWIW, I tested &#38;lt;textarea style=&#38;quot;caret-shape:block&#38;quot;&#38;gt; with a simplified 
&#38;gt; Chinese IME on macOS, and I failed to make it misbehave in some obvious 
&#38;gt; way. When stepping back to put the caret within the currently uncommitted 
&#38;gt; text can insert a space in the string that is the size of a block caret, 
&#38;gt; but it does that regardless of the caret shape it seems.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; P.S. I also tested caret-shape:🥕 but no hidden easter egg...

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Am I correct in understanding that we can ship and follow up with the IME 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issue?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Regardless we will capture the IME behavior and update the CSS WG issue. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; With some luck we can get it discussed soon.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Stephen, Ziran, how does this interact with IME in Chromium? Can you

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The shape of the caret in native applications is most commonly a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; vertical bar, an underscore or a rectangular block. In addition, the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; shape 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; often varies depending on the input mode, such as insert or replace. The 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; CSS caret-shape property allows sites to choose one of these shapes for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; caret inside editable elements, or leave the choice up to the browser. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; recognized property values are auto, bar, block and underscore.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; commented - &#38;quot;Seems reasonable; I&#39;d suggest a &#38;quot;positive&#38;quot; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; standards-position. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; There are a handful of use-cases that use a caret-shape: block sort of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rendering that I can find - e.g. gnome-terminal (which lets you choose 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; between Block, I-Beam, and Underline) and the graphical version of emacs. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; And it seems useful for the web platform to offer the same sort of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cosmetic 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; flexibility in matching that caret-style, for web developers who are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; designing a web-based application inspired by these sorts of native 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; applications. (Masayuki mentions a case in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715487#c0&#34;&#38;gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715487#c0&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; where this 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sort of feature might make things easier for Korean IME users, too; so 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; there&#39;s potentially a usability benefit for some international 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; audiences.)&#38;quot;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Support for character-level and glyph-level mirroring when rendering
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; MathML operators in right-to-left mode. When using RTL mode some operators
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; can be mirrored by changing them to another code point (e.g. a right
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; parentheses becomes a left parentheses). This is character-level mirroring,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with equivalences defined by Unicode&#39;s `Bidi_Mirrored` property. There are
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; operators that have no appropriate mirroring character. Glyph-level
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mirroring applies in this case, with the `rtlm` font feature, where another
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; glyph can replace it in a mirrored context. Some existing implementations
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mirror the original glyph directly, but this may change the meaning for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; asymmetrical characters, such as the clockwise contour integral.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; right-to-left mode, where operators need to be correctly mirrored.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Sometimes, a simple horizontal flip is not enough. In the case of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; asymmetrical glyphs like a clockwise contour integral doing so would change
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the meaning of the symbol. That&#39;s why both character-level mirroring and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; glyph-level mirroring is needed to produce a correct mathematical
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; expression in RTL mode. The following explainer shows the different cases
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to consider when mirroring stretchy characters, as well as the proposed
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; MathML Core spec amendments to support this use case:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; New tests: - Character-level mirroring: checks that when switching text
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; direction the codepoints of the characters change to the corresponding
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; BidiMirrored equivalent (e.g. right to left parentheses) - Glyph-level
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mirroring: checks that the rtlm font feature is supported and that a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specific glyph is used for certain characters when switching text direction.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with plans to make it fully available within the next months.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption expectation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Feature is used for the case of rendering right to left math.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Adoption plan*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It will ship enabled by default so users can start benefiting from it.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;What I would suggest is to test the current behavior and make any changes
you think are necessary for a good user experience, to report that on the
issue and then ship.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

FWIW, I tested &#38;lt;textarea style=&#38;quot;caret-shape:block&#38;quot;&#38;gt; with a simplified
Chinese IME on macOS, and I failed to make it misbehave in some obvious
way. When stepping back to put the caret within the currently uncommitted
text can insert a space in the string that is the size of a block caret,
but it does that regardless of the caret shape it seems.

P.S. I also tested caret-shape:🥕 but no hidden easter egg...

&#38;gt; Am I correct in understanding that we can ship and follow up with the IME
&#38;gt; issue?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Regardless we will capture the IME behavior and update the CSS WG issue.
&#38;gt; With some luck we can get it discussed soon.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui/#caret-shape&#34;&#38;gt;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui/#caret-shape&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The shape of the caret in native applications is most commonly a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; vertical bar, an underscore or a rectangular block. In addition, the shape
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; often varies depending on the input mode, such as insert or replace. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; CSS caret-shape property allows sites to choose one of these shapes for the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; caret inside editable elements, or leave the choice up to the browser. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; recognized property values are auto, bar, block and underscore.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; commented - &#38;quot;Seems reasonable; I&#39;d suggest a &#38;quot;positive&#38;quot; standards-position.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; There are a handful of use-cases that use a caret-shape: block sort of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rendering that I can find - e.g. gnome-terminal (which lets you choose
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; between Block, I-Beam, and Underline) and the graphical version of emacs.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; And it seems useful for the web platform to offer the same sort of cosmetic
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; flexibility in matching that caret-style, for web developers who are
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; designing a web-based application inspired by these sorts of native
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; applications. (Masayuki mentions a case in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715487#c0&#34;&#38;gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715487#c0&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; where this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sort of feature might make things easier for Korean IME users, too; so
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; there&#39;s potentially a usability benefit for some international audiences.)&#38;quot;

&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Yes, LGTM3. If it turns out that this issue is somehow going to cause 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;serious issues for users (it&#39;s not clear to me at all if this is the 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;case) and the WG decides on something that affects what we ship, please 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;follow up.

    LGTM2

    Stephen, Ziran, how does this interact with IME in Chromium? Can
    you document the behavior in
    &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/13055&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/13055&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; and follow up to
    align with the WG resolution when there is one? Updating this
    thread when that happens would be much appreciated.

            *Summary*
            The shape of the caret in native applications is most
            commonly a vertical bar, an underscore or a rectangular
            block. In addition, the shape often varies depending on
            the input mode, such as insert or replace. The CSS
            caret-shape property allows sites to choose one of these
            shapes for the caret inside editable elements, or leave
            the choice up to the browser. The recognized property
            values are auto, bar, block and underscore.

            commented - &#38;quot;Seems reasonable; I&#39;d suggest a &#38;quot;positive&#38;quot;
            standards-position. There are a handful of use-cases that
            use a caret-shape: block sort of rendering that I can
            find - e.g. gnome-terminal (which lets you choose between
            Block, I-Beam, and Underline) and the graphical version
            of emacs. And it seems useful for the web platform to
            offer the same sort of cosmetic flexibility in matching
            that caret-style, for web developers who are designing a
            web-based application inspired by these sorts of native
            applications. (Masayuki mentions a case in
            &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715487#c0&#34;&#38;gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715487#c0&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
            where this sort of feature might make things easier for
            Korean IME users, too; so there&#39;s potentially a usability
            benefit for some international audiences.)&#38;quot;

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hi Frank,

Since this is TC39 we don&#39;t need a position request as long as it&#39;s at
stage 3. Sorry, my mistake.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; API owner is asking about  the position from WebKit so we need a Safari TR

&#38;gt; &#38;quot;What about webkit? Could you file a standards position request for them?&#38;quot;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

release note or WebKit bug tracking for this I think.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;quot;What about webkit? Could you file a standards position request for them?&#38;quot;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

&#38;gt; There should be one right?
&#38;gt;
Finch flag is XMLNoExternalEntities - updated in Chromestatus entry.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome synchronously fetches external XML entities/DTDs and incorporates
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; them into parsing under specific circumstances. I propose to remove this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; functionality.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Test case xml-external-entity.xml
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/security/contentTypeOptions/xml-external-entity.xml&#34;&#38;gt;https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/security/contentTypeOptions/xml-external-entity.xml&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; gives an example:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &#38;quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;         &#38;quot;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&#38;quot&#34;&#38;gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&#38;quot&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; [
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;!ENTITY entity_application_xml_external_parsed_entity SYSTEM &#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/contentTypeOptions/resources/script-with-header.pl?mime=application/xml-external-parsed-entity&#34;&#38;gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/contentTypeOptions/resources/script-with-header.pl?mime=application/xml-external-parsed-entity&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ...
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; External entities can be defined in the trailing part of the DOCTYPE
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; statement - and then refer to resources that are to be synchronously loaded
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and included as context when parsing XML.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Another syntax example would be a DOCTYPE that, using the SYSTEM keyword
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; followed by a URL pointing to a DTD which contains additional entity
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; definitions.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Such external load requests are passed up from the parser and allowed
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; only if they are a same origin request and the response mimetype matches:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application/xml-external-parsed-entity.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; According to &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#proc-types&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#proc-types&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; non-validating
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; processor are not required to read external entities.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Blink component*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; DOM
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Web Feature ID*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Falls under XML feature group, but did not see a specific parsing feature.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The usage has continuously decreased and is at an extremely low level of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 0.000015, compare:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/529&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/529&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; We
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; intend to improve the security of XML parsing in Chrome. (See internal
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; go/chrome_x_mitigation).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In this effort, we intend to replace libxml2 as the XML parser with an
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; XML parser written in Rust (crate &#38;quot;xml&#38;quot;). The Rust-based XML parser we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; intend to migrate to, does not support external entities and we don&#39;t think
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; it&#39;s necessary or desirable to implement this feature.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Synchronous loads during parsing are considered inefficient, and can be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; avoided by inlining the needed entity definitions.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; As usage is so low, Firefox never supported this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22942#c135&#34;&#38;gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22942#c135&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;, I propose to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; deprecate in 144, and remove in 145.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Initial public proposal*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No information provided
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Parsing success/failure is debuggable, same as before.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Requires code in //chrome?*

Hi Philip, Thanks for the approval!

Providing inputs to your comments below:

&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thanks for the links, I think that the &#38;quot;meaning&#38;quot; in &#38;quot;allowed values 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;and meaning&#38;quot; is supposed to imply that the same processing model and 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;algorithm should be used. I do think it would be better if the SVG 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;spec was more explicit, but that&#39;s practically an editorial concern.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;    Got it, I see your point, I will raise this as an issue to update 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;the spec for SVG &#38;lt;a&#38;gt; element so that the meaning is a little more 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;clear in terms of processing model and algorithm as well.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/blockquote&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;
Is there an issue we can follow along to track this?
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;blockquote style=&#34;border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em&#34;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;&#38;gt; If there is any difference at all between SVG &#38;lt;a&#38;gt; and HTML &#38;lt;a&#38;gt; in how 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;these four attributes are handled I think that needs to be spec&#39;d and 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;tested, but if it&#39;s all the same then this seems straightforward.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;    And yes, attributes in HTML &#38;lt;a&#38;gt; and SVG &#38;lt;a&#38;gt; are expected to behave 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;the same.

    Hi Philip, SVG2.0 does indeed defines these attributes by giving
    references of corresponding definitions of HTML &#38;lt;a&#38;gt; tag attributes.

    Moreover, SVG2.0 says:
    /These attributes further describe the targetted resource and its

    are //as defined for the

    But let me know if these references are enough for defining the
    behaviour?

    ping, hreflang, type and referrerPolicy for SVGAElement
    Hi Divyansh!

    Thanks for working to align SVG and HTML &#38;lt;a&#38;gt; elements!

    Can you confirm if
    &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/linking.html#InterfaceSVGAElement&#34;&#38;gt;https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/linking.html#InterfaceSVGAElement&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

    defines all of the behavior you&#39;d like to ship here? In particular
    for ping and referrerPolicy, it&#39;s non-trivial, and the SVG spec
    itself doesn&#39;t seem to define anything beyond the IDL attribute
    reflection.

    I think that updating
    &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#hyperlink-auditing&#34;&#38;gt;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#hyperlink-auditing&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

    SVG &#38;lt;a&#38;gt; or to somehow invoke HTML from the SVG spec would be
    enough. Unless this is already covered somewhere I&#39;m not seeing,
    can you look into making the appropriate spec changes?

    Best regards,
    Philip

        *Summary*
        Adds support for ping, hreflang, type, and referrerPolicy
        attributes on SVGAElement, aligning its behavior with
        HTMLAnchorElement for consistent link handling across HTML and
        SVG.

        *Motivation*
        The SVGAElement interface in SVG 2.0 is evolving to align more
        closely with HTML anchor elements, now supporting attributes
        like ping, hreflang, type, and referrerPolicy. This promotes
        consistency across web technologies and gives developers more
        control over link behavior and metadata.

        ping: Specifies URLs to be notified when a link is followed,
        enabling lightweight tracking and analytics without disrupting
        navigation.

        hreflang: Indicates the language of the linked resource,
        improving accessibility and helping search engines serve
        localized content.

        type: Declares the MIME type of the linked resource, allowing
        smarter handling and performance optimization.

        referrerPolicy: Controls how much referrer info is sent when
        navigating. Policies like no-referrer or
        strict-origin-when-cross-origin enhance privacy and security.

        These enhancements make SVG links more powerful, predictable,
        and aligned with modern web standards.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Thanks both, I think you&#39;re spot on with these concerns, both could cause
potential breakage and we&#39;ll have to work through them as part of the
deprecation. It should be possible to look at data for both of these cases,
although to Rick&#39;s point it may only be possible once we&#39;ve worked through
the list of partners with Related Website Sets.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

I&#39;m very confident that outside of the known list of RWS users both
checking for existence of rSAFor and potentially problematic permissions
checks should be rare enough that I&#39;d still like to seek API Owner approval
for this intent right now, also to unblock the outreach to these partners
with a reference to the deprecation process in Chrome.

I believe that a viable worst-case option for the M150 timeline could be to
simply no-op the API (and the permissions API integration) without RWS
support while we track down remaining usage.

&#38;gt; One concern I have is once we remove the `top-level-storage-access`
&#38;gt; permission, `navigator.permissions.query` will throw a TypeError. Of the
&#38;gt; ~1% of pages using rSAFor, do we know how many of them are using
&#38;gt; `navigator.permissions.query`?

&#38;gt; That said, your point about it applying just to the relatively small
&#38;gt; number of sites on the RWS list is a good one. I do expect you&#39;re right
&#38;gt; that it&#39;ll be easy to drive down usage and I&#39;d also guess that the vast
&#38;gt; majority of usage would be gated by a feature detect, right? Just feels
&#38;gt; like we&#39;ll need a bit more evidence to demonstrate why we know this will be
&#38;gt; safe to remove given the high UseCounter.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This one seems a bit trickier than RWS itself because we have to reason
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; about the risk of code that assumes the API exists. I am supportive of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; deprecation now, but perhaps we should come back to the data after RWS is
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; removed and see what the usage severity of breakage is in practice before
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; approving removal?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Summary
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The requestStorageAccessFor (rSAFor) API is an extension to the Storage
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Access API that allows a top-level site to request access to unpartitioned
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (&#38;quot;first-party&#38;quot;) cookies on behalf of embedded sites. Browsers will have
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; discretion to grant or deny access, with mechanisms like Related Website
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Sets (RWS) membership as a potential signal. This allows for use of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Storage Access API by top-level sites. Following Chrome&#39;s announcement that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the current approach to third-party cookies will be maintained, we are now
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; planning to deprecate and remove rSAFor, as it is only usable in Chrome to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; request storage access between RWS sites. Related Website Sets will also be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; deprecated via a separate intent.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Motivation
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome has announced
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that the current approach to third-party cookies will be maintained. rSAFor
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; currently has usage on about 0.95% of page loads
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4332&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4332&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but any website relying on successful invocation of rSAFor (i.e. the API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; returns a promise that resolves) must also have registered a set on the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RWS GitHub
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; repository
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/related_website_sets.JSON&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/related_website_sets.JSON&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Any invocations of rSAFor outside of an RWS currently returns a promise
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that is rejected.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Our metrics suggest that almost all of the usage of rSAFor is from
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; websites that have registered sets. We will continue to monitor usage and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; aim to drive it down prior to removal by proactively informing set owners
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of the deprecation timelines and request them to turn down usage.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Additionally, other browser engines have not signaled interest in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementing the API, obviating any interoperability concerns.

&#38;gt; This has some risk of being a breaking change, right? How would
&#38;gt; you characterize that risk? Firefox having this is obviously a good sign,
&#38;gt; but any other data or arguments on the risk? I imagine SVG use is fairly
&#38;gt; rare, and any selector mismatch would most likely be a minor formatting
&#38;gt; issue, right?
&#38;gt;

An instantiated subtree will no longer be able to do selector matching
against the surrounding elements from where it was instantiated from.

In the following case, the use instance of the rect would no longer be red:

&#38;lt;!DOCTYPE html&#38;gt;
&#38;lt;style&#38;gt;
  .original rect { fill: red; }
  rect { fill: green; }
&#38;lt;/style&#38;gt;
&#38;lt;svg&#38;gt;
  &#38;lt;defs class=&#38;quot;original&#38;quot;&#38;gt;
    &#38;lt;rect id=&#38;quot;r&#38;quot; x=&#38;quot;0&#38;quot; y=&#38;quot;0&#38;quot; width=&#38;quot;100&#38;quot; height=&#38;quot;100&#38;quot; /&#38;gt;
  &#38;lt;/defs&#38;gt;
  &#38;lt;use href=&#38;quot;#r&#38;quot;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/use&#38;gt;
&#38;lt;/svg&#38;gt;

I think this is unlikely to break real sites.

In order to use-count this, we would have to run both ways of cascading (or
at least selector matching) to detect such cases.

The main benefit from this change, I think, is that it fixes

matching which is currently broken in &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instances.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The WebKit standards position was only filed yesterday, but this seems
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; straightforward and aligns with spec+Firefox, so I don&#39;t think we should
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; wait on it. In the unlikely event there is feedback, please ping this

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Align the Blink implementation with the SVG2 specification for matching
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; CSS rules in &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; element trees.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Match selectors against the &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instantiation elements instead of the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; originating element subtree. This means selectors will no longer match
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ancestor and sibling elements outside the cloned subtree. More importantly,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; state selectors like :hover will now start matching in &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instances.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may

Hi,

It&#39;s not impossible. To achieve this, you can include the script for the
XSLT polyfill mentioned in this thread in the response from your server.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Well technically XPath is an autonous language and is a strong basis of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; XSLT
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (1) It would help to clarify XPath status
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; That&#39;s fair! To clarify, we are absolutely *not* removing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `document.evaluate()` or XPath generally.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (2) it would be helpful to know if there is way to reactivate those API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if we solve the security issues (via rust implementation ?)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; By &#38;quot;those APIs&#38;quot; I assume you mean XSLT. If so, unfortunately that&#39;s not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; our current plan, no.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Just to verify, this will not remove document.evaluate which depends
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; on XPath - right? It is the only way to natively find an element by text
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and other advanced combinations as far as I know.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yep, great question. We are absolutely *not* removing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `document.evaluate()` or XPath generally. That&#39;s part of XML, not XSLT.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (Side note, there are other native methods such as NodeIterator /
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; TreeWalker, but those obviously don&#39;t offer such a compact way to search
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for text content.)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hey, we discussed this at API owners today.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Generally, we&#39;re supportive of removing XSLT. As for the plan, I
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; think it would be best if we disable this in Canary as soon as possible
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (via Finch) to find real breakages that we may be missing. Further,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; disabling in Beta and Dev shortly after to get more data is also good.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; LGTM1 for the plan with the above changes. We would like you to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; check in with results of Canary / Dev / Beta and warning steps in 3 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; months
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to see how we proceed further.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;I have a statically hosted website and I should like to add formatting to 
my RSS feed so that other people will get a pleasant experience when they 
click on the link. This seems impossible without XSLT. Perhaps I&#39;m just old 
fashioned, but I think generally browser should support the basic 
technologies you&#39;d need to write HTML documents and serve them to people.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Well technically XPath is an autonous language and is a strong basis of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; XSLT
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (1) It would help to clarify XPath status 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; That&#39;s fair! To clarify, we are absolutely *not* removing 
&#38;gt; `document.evaluate()` or XPath generally.
&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (2) it would be helpful to know if there is way to reactivate those API 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if we solve the security issues (via rust implementation ?)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; By &#38;quot;those APIs&#38;quot; I assume you mean XSLT. If so, unfortunately that&#39;s not 
&#38;gt; our current plan, no.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Just to verify, this will not remove document.evaluate which depends 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; on XPath - right? It is the only way to natively find an element by text 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and other advanced combinations as far as I know.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yep, great question. We are absolutely *not* removing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `document.evaluate()` or XPath generally. That&#39;s part of XML, not XSLT. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (Side note, there are other native methods such as NodeIterator / 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; TreeWalker, but those obviously don&#39;t offer such a compact way to search 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for text content.)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hey, we discussed this at API owners today. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Generally, we&#39;re supportive of removing XSLT. As for the plan, I 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; think it would be best if we disable this in Canary as soon as possible 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (via Finch) to find real breakages that we may be missing. Further, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; disabling in Beta and Dev shortly after to get more data is also good. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; LGTM1 for the plan with the above changes. We would like you to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; check in with results of Canary / Dev / Beta and warning steps in 3 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; months 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to see how we proceed further.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; Adds the JavaScript type SharedArrayBuffer gated behind COOP/COEP. The
&#38;gt; concept of a SharedArrayBuffer is that a message to a worker, is posted but
&#38;gt; instead of copying the content of the array just a reference to it is
&#38;gt; shared. The Atomic API provides atomic loads and stores and
&#38;gt; Read/Modify/Write accesses to SharedArrayBuffers. The Atomic.wait provides
&#38;gt; the ability for a worker to wait for another worker to signal it, without
&#38;gt; having to spinlock.

&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Goals for experimentation*
&#38;gt; *No information provided*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Reason this experiment is being extended*
&#38;gt; This is a deprecation trial, and we&#39;re giving more time to websites to
&#38;gt; stop using the deprecated behavior.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Reason this experiment is being extended*
&#38;gt; The release of DocumentIsolationPolicy in M137 is helping developers adopt
&#38;gt; crossOriginIsolation as a way out of this reverse Origin Trial. However, it
&#38;gt; will still take time for developers to adopt. We would like to extend the
&#38;gt; OT as the final extension and give developers 6 milestones to get out of
&#38;gt; this reverse Origin Trial. Once this is approved and developers have
&#38;gt; requested their token, we will close this trial so that no further origins
&#38;gt; adopt the deprecated behavior.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Reason this experiment is being extended*
&#38;gt; We still have one of the historic users of ungated SharedArrayBuffers
&#38;gt; which has not managed to transition to cross-origin isolation (Google
&#38;gt; Earth). They are in the process of deploying COEP and asked us for an
&#38;gt; extension of the reverse origin trial until M146, when they believe they
&#38;gt; will be done with COEP deployment. Once the extension is approved, we&#39;ll
&#38;gt; close the Origin Trial to ensure no new users can register.

&#38;gt; we discussed closing new registrations and only allowing exiting
&#38;gt; registrations to renew. Was this ever set up? (if so, it seems to have
&#38;gt; regressed, from what I can tell).

&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;One concern I have is once we remove the `top-level-storage-access` 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;permission, `navigator.permissions.query` will throw a TypeError. Of the 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;~1% of pages using rSAFor, do we know how many of them are using 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;`navigator.permissions.query`?

    This one seems a bit trickier than RWS itself because we have to
    reason about the risk of code that assumes the API exists. I am
    supportive of deprecation now, but perhaps we should come back to
    the data after RWS is removed and see what the usage severity of
    breakage is in practice before approving removal?

            Summary

            The requestStorageAccessFor (rSAFor) API is an extension
            to the Storage Access API that allows a top-level site to
            request access to unpartitioned (&#38;quot;first-party&#38;quot;) cookies on
            behalf of embedded sites. Browsers will have discretion to
            grant or deny access, with mechanisms like Related Website
            Sets (RWS) membership as a potential signal. This allows
            for use of the Storage Access API by top-level sites.
            Following Chrome&#39;s announcement that the current approach
            to third-party cookies will be maintained, we are now
            planning to deprecate and remove rSAFor, as it is only
            usable in Chrome to request storage access between RWS
            sites. Related Website Sets will also be deprecated via a
            separate intent.

            Web Feature ID

            None


            Motivation

            Chrome has announced
            
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;that
            the current approach to third-party cookies will be
            maintained. rSAFor currently has usage on about 0.95% of
            page loads
            &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4332&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4332&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;,
            but any website relying on successful invocation of rSAFor
            (i.e. the API returns a promise that resolves) must also
            have registered a set on the RWS GitHub repository
            
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/related_website_sets.JSON&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/related_website_sets.JSON&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.
            Any invocations of rSAFor outside of an RWS currently
            returns a promise that is rejected.


            Our metrics suggest that almost all of the usage of rSAFor
            is from websites that have registered sets. We will
            continue to monitor usage and aim to drive it down prior
            to removal by proactively informing set owners of the
            deprecation timelines and request them to turn down usage.
            Additionally, other browser engines have not signaled
            interest in implementing the API, obviating any
            interoperability concerns.

&#38;gt; If the solution is this simple, why are users being expected to implement

&#38;gt; Surely the browser could be made to dispatch this polyfill whenever it
&#38;gt; encounters a document with the stylesheet tag.
&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Unfortunately, for lots of technical reasons, integrating it directly into
the browser (and maintaining thereafter) is much harder than it might seem.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hi,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It&#39;s not impossible. To achieve this, you can include the script for the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; XSLT polyfill mentioned in this thread in the response from your server.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Well technically XPath is an autonous language and is a strong basis
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of XSLT
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (1) It would help to clarify XPath status
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; That&#39;s fair! To clarify, we are absolutely *not* removing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `document.evaluate()` or XPath generally.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (2) it would be helpful to know if there is way to reactivate those
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API if we solve the security issues (via rust implementation ?)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; By &#38;quot;those APIs&#38;quot; I assume you mean XSLT. If so, unfortunately that&#39;s not
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; our current plan, no.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Just to verify, this will not remove document.evaluate which
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; depends on XPath - right? It is the only way to natively find an

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yep, great question. We are absolutely *not* removing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `document.evaluate()` or XPath generally. That&#39;s part of XML, not XSLT.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (Side note, there are other native methods such as NodeIterator /
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; TreeWalker, but those obviously don&#39;t offer such a compact way to search

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Generally, we&#39;re supportive of removing XSLT. As for the plan, I
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; think it would be best if we disable this in Canary as soon as 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; possible
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (via Finch) to find real breakages that we may be missing. Further,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; disabling in Beta and Dev shortly after to get more data is also 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; good.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; LGTM1 for the plan with the above changes. We would like you to

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;As we announced in the recent Protected Audience Intent to Deprecate and 
Remove &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/k_nubsMb97g&#34;&#38;gt;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/k_nubsMb97g&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;, 
Protected Audience features that were never launched beyond 20% Stable will 
be ramped down by the end of 2025.  This includes Protected Audience 
k-Anonymity Enforcement since this was never launched beyond 20% Stable. 
Given that it was never launched beyond 20% and that there are virtually no 
auctions with winners today which could be affected by this change, we 
don’t expect this change to have a noticeable impact.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This did not affect ad selection and therefore should have had little or no 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; impact on auction dynamic or pressure.  To mitigate this issue, we briefly 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; turned off k-anonymity enforcement on all Chrome traffic. We have landed a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; high confidence fix for this issue and have started ramping back up 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; k-anonymity enforcement on eligible traffic1 that has the fix. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The application of k-anonymity enforcement in Mode A and Mode B traffic 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; did not affect ad selection, i.e. no winning ads were removed because the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; creative URLs were below the k-anonymity threshold and the creative URLs 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; would continue to be available in reportWin() and reportResult().  The 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; k-anonymity enforcement on reporting means that some Mode A and Mode B 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; traffic may have been inadvertently missing interestGroupName, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; buyerReportingId, or buyerAndSellerReportingId in reportWin(), and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; buyerAndSellerReportingId in reportResult(), in cases where the value, when 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; combined with the interest group owner, bidding script URL, and ad creative 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; URL was not jointly k-anonymous. Adtech scripts should properly handle the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lack of these values in reportWin() and reportResult() as they’ve always 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; been intended and specified as optional and missing when they don’t meet 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the k-anonymity threshold. However, we understand that the current 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementations may not have reached this stage of development.  Here’s a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; timeline of how k-anonymity enforcement was ramped:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; k-anon enforcement disabled, ~0%
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Apr 2
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fix deployed, ramping back up, &#38;lt;1%
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We have started ramping  k-anonymity enforcement up on pre-stable and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; plan to continue ramping on eligible traffic1. We apologize for the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; inconvenience caused by this disruption. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 1 Eligible traffic is pre-stable and stable channels, excluding Mode A 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and Mode B traffic.

&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;LGTM3 - Risk seems manageable even though it&#39;s unfortunately hard to 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;measure. That it has worked for such a long time in Gecko without major 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;push towards something else is a good sign. Good luck. We&#39;re all

    This has some risk of being a breaking change, right? How would

&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;years ago and the reported regressions were due to implementation bugs

&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;cascading (or at least selector matching) to detect such cases.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/blockquote&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;This sounds like a lot of complexity (but feel free to respond telling

        The WebKit standards position was only filed yesterday, but
        this seems straightforward and aligns with spec+Firefox, so I
        don&#39;t think we should wait on it. In the unlikely event there
        is feedback, please ping this thread.

            *Summary*
            Align the Blink implementation with the SVG2
            specification for matching CSS rules in &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; element trees.

            Match selectors against the &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instantiation elements
            instead of the originating element subtree. This means
            selectors will no longer match ancestor and sibling
            elements outside the cloned subtree. More importantly,
            state selectors like :hover will now start matching in
            &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instances.

            *Motivation*
            CSS selectors match against the wrong tree for &#38;lt;use&#38;gt;
            instantiations, which means selectors do not match
            correctly for structural relationships and user
            interaction state (see :hover issue that will be fixed

            *Interoperability and Compatibility*
            Firefox has shipped the SVG2 behavior for years. Bug for

            *WebView application risks*

            Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing
            APIs, such that it has potentially high risk for Android
            WebView-based applications?

            *Anticipated spec changes*

            Open questions about a feature may be a source of future
            web compat or interop issues. Please list open issues
            (e.g. links to known github issues in the project for the
            feature specification) whose resolution may introduce web
            compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or
            structure of the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Such external load requests are passed up from the parser and allowed
only if they are a same origin request and the response mimetype matches:
application/xml-external-parsed-entity.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

One correction:
The mimetype restriction does not apply: External entities are loaded even
without mimetype checking when X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff is not set.

Also, additional details were found regarding overlaps with XSLT processing:

XMLDocumentParser OpenFunc is called in multiple situations. Detailed analysis
here &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://issues.chromium.org/u/1/issues/455813733#comment4&#34;&#38;gt;https://issues.chromium.org/u/1/issues/455813733#comment4&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;. In XSLT
processing context, external loads for DTD and external entities are
currently allowed.
With these findings, I only intend to deprecate and remove this for non
XSLT situations.

Even though the usage is very low overall, there is no need to risk XSLT
breakage and cause interference between this deprecation and the XSLT
deprecation.

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; Chrome synchronously fetches external XML entities/DTDs and incorporates
&#38;gt; them into parsing under specific circumstances. I propose to remove this
&#38;gt; functionality.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Test case xml-external-entity.xml
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/security/contentTypeOptions/xml-external-entity.xml&#34;&#38;gt;https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/web_tests/http/tests/security/contentTypeOptions/xml-external-entity.xml&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; gives an example:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &#38;quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;         &#38;quot;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&#38;quot&#34;&#38;gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&#38;quot&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;;
&#38;gt; [
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;!ENTITY entity_application_xml_external_parsed_entity SYSTEM &#38;quot;
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/contentTypeOptions/resources/script-with-header.pl?mime=application/xml-external-parsed-entity&#34;&#38;gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/contentTypeOptions/resources/script-with-header.pl?mime=application/xml-external-parsed-entity&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;quot;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; ...
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; External entities can be defined in the trailing part of the DOCTYPE
&#38;gt; statement - and then refer to resources that are to be synchronously loaded
&#38;gt; and included as context when parsing XML.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Another syntax example would be a DOCTYPE that, using the SYSTEM keyword
&#38;gt; followed by a URL pointing to a DTD which contains additional entity
&#38;gt; definitions.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Such external load requests are passed up from the parser and allowed only
&#38;gt; if they are a same origin request and the response mimetype matches:
&#38;gt; application/xml-external-parsed-entity.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; According to &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#proc-types&#34;&#38;gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#proc-types&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; non-validating
&#38;gt; processor are not required to read external entities.

&#38;gt; Falls under XML feature group, but did not see a specific parsing feature.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt; The usage has continuously decreased and is at an extremely low level of
&#38;gt; 0.000015, compare:
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/529&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/529&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; We
&#38;gt; intend to improve the security of XML parsing in Chrome. (See internal
&#38;gt; go/chrome_x_mitigation).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; In this effort, we intend to replace libxml2 as the XML parser with an XML
&#38;gt; parser written in Rust (crate &#38;quot;xml&#38;quot;). The Rust-based XML parser we intend
&#38;gt; to migrate to, does not support external entities and we don&#39;t think it&#39;s
&#38;gt; necessary or desirable to implement this feature.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Synchronous loads during parsing are considered inefficient, and can be
&#38;gt; avoided by inlining the needed entity definitions.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; As usage is so low, Firefox never supported this
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22942#c135&#34;&#38;gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22942#c135&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;, I propose to
&#38;gt; deprecate in 144, and remove in 145.

&#38;gt; *Initial public proposal*

    LGTM1 to deprecate. The plan to keep deprecation for 6 milestones
    also sounds good. Please come back to this thread at a time when
    you think the removal can proceed. Since the amount of page loads
    is high, we would like to reserve the right to pause the removal
    if this amount of page loads does not decrease substantially.

        &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://patcg-individual-drafts.github.io/private-aggregation-api&#34;&#38;gt;https://patcg-individual-drafts.github.io/private-aggregation-api&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

        Summary

        The Private Aggregation API is a generic mechanism for
        measuring aggregate, cross-site data in a privacy preserving
        manner. It was originally designed for a future without
        third-party cookies.


        Following Chrome&#39;s announcement that the current approach to
        third-party cookies will be maintained, we are now planning to
        deprecate and remove the Private Aggregation API (along with
        certain other Privacy Sandbox APIs, as outlined on the Privacy
        Sandbox feature status page
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.google.com/overview/status&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.google.com/overview/status&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;). This API
        is only exposed via the Shared Storage and Protected Audience
        APIs, which are also planned to be deprecated and removed. So,
        no additional work will be required for Private Aggregation.

        Web Feature ID

        None


        Motivation

        Chrome has announced
        
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;that
        the current approach to third-party cookies will be
        maintained. Given this, we expect adoption of the Private
        Aggregation API to decrease over time as cross-site
        measurement will remain possible in Chrome using third-party
        cookies. Further, other browser engines have not signaled
        interest in launching the API. Removing this (and certain
        other Privacy Sandbox APIs
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.google.com/overview/status&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.google.com/overview/status&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;) will help
        focus efforts on the proposed interoperable Attribution
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/attribution&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/attribution&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;standard.


        Possible breakage

        Sites that rely on Private Aggregation reports for cross-site
        measurement and do not migrate to alternative solutions will
        experience a disruption on the removal of the API.


        No specific JavaScript API changes are required to remove
        Private Aggregation as the API is only exposed within
        Protected Audience and Shared Storage contexts. So, Private
        Aggregation’s functionality is planned to be transitively
        removed by the removal of those two APIs.


        If usage warrants, the Protected Audience and Shared Storage
        APIs may be temporarily retained with stub/no-op
        implementations of their calls to avoid any risk of page
        breakage. In that case, the isolated contexts where Private
        Aggregation is exposed would still no longer be created and
        there would be no need to retain a stub implementation of
        Private Aggregation.

        There will be one aspect of the API that will end sooner.
        Server-side

        report computation will no longer operate by late December
        2025. We have already communicated to the users of that
        service of these plans. Such users can use debug reports
        instead until the removal of the API surface as a whole. Since
        this impacts post-facto server-side operations, it will not
        incur any user-facing breakage.


        Currently ~3%
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4333&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4333&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;of
        page loads use the Private Aggregation API. While this usage
        is quite high for a deprecation and removal, it is driven by a
        small number of third-party ad tech scripts present on a large
        number of sites. We will continue to monitor usage in addition
        to providing comprehensive updates on
        privacysandbox.google.com
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.google.com/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.google.com/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;with the status of the API

        We will proactively work toward reducing usage to low levels
        once this intent is approved, including disallowing any new
        enrollment sign-ups, and contacting enrolled sites to inform
        them about the deprecation timelines.


        Please see Protected Audience and Shared Storage’s Intents to
        Deprecate and Remove for plans in case usage is still too high
        to fully remove those APIs at M150 due to user-facing breakage
        concerns.

    Summary

    The Attribution Reporting API (ARA) is a privacy-preserving web
    API designed to measure ad conversions without third-party
    cookies or user tracking across sites.


    Following Chrome&#39;s announcement
    &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-next-steps/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-next-steps/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;that
    the current approach to third-party cookies will be maintained,
    we are now planning to deprecate and remove

    Attribution Reporting API (along with certain other Privacy
    Sandbox APIs, as outlined on the Privacy Sandbox feature status

    Motivation

    Chrome has announced
    
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;that
    the current approach to third-party cookies will be maintained.
    Given this, we expect adoption of the Attribution Reporting API
    to decrease over time, as cross-site measurement will remain
    possible in Chrome using third-party cookies. Further, although
    Microsoft Edge integrates with the Attribution Reporting API,
    most other browser engines have not signaled interest in
    launching the API. Removing this (and certain other Privacy
    Sandbox APIs &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.google.com/overview/status&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.google.com/overview/status&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;)
    will help focus efforts on the proposed interoperable Attribution

    Developer-facing impact

    Sites that are using the Attribution Reporting API for conversion
    measurement and do not migrate to alternative solutions may
    experience a disruption in conversion measurement on eventual
    removal of the API code from Chrome.


     *

        Conversion measurement disruption:All ad conversion events
        relying on the deprecated API will fail to register or
        report. Sites using this API as their primary or
        supplementary method for ad measurement will lose visibility
        into campaign performance metrics derived from this technology.

     *

        Public API surface:The following outlines the consequences of
        deprecating and removing the Attribution Reporting API for
        each of the interfaces defined here
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/attribution-reporting-api/#idl-index&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/attribution-reporting-api/#idl-index&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.

            Potentially user-breaking

             +

                XMLHttpRequest.setAttributionReporting(): Calling
                setAttributionReporting()on an XMLHttpRequestobject
                will throw an exception because the method will no
                longer exist. This is a breaking change for any site
                that calls this method. Given that this feature is
                not implemented in other browsers, it is likely that
                sites are already using feature detection to check
                the method’s existence before calling it, which would
                prevent breakage. We will start to track the usage of
                this method.

         o

            Non user-breaking

             +

                HTMLAttributionSrcElementUtilsand the
                attributionsrcattribute: The attributionsrcattribute
                on &#38;lt;a&#38;gt;, &#38;lt;area&#38;gt;, &#38;lt;img&#38;gt;, and &#38;lt;script&#38;gt; elements will be
                ignored. Any values assigned to this attribute will
                have no effect, and the browser will no longer
                initiate background requests to register attribution
                sources/triggers. Additionally we will no longer
                process trigger headers on legacy subresource
                requests that lack the opt-in (either on an element
                or fetch/XHR). This will not cause any visible
                breakage or errors on the page for the user, but it
                will silently prevent conversion measurement for
                sites that rely on this attribute.

             +

                attributionsrcin window.open(): The
                attributionsrcfeature in the featuresstring of a
                window.open()call will be ignored. The window will
                still open as requested, but no attribution source
                will be registered. This will not cause any visible
                breakage or errors on the pages for the user, but it
                will silently prevent conversion measurement for
                sites that rely on this functionality.

             +

                AttributionReportingRequestOptionsand the
                attributionReportingmember in RequestInit: The
                attributionReportingproperty within the options of a
                fetch() call will be ignored. The fetch request will
                still be made, but it will not trigger any
                attribution-related functionality. This change will
                not cause any JavaScript errors, but conversion
                measurement that relies on the fetch requests will no
                longer work.

             +

                Attribution-Reporting-Eligibleand
                Attribution-Reporting-Supportheaders: Since the
                browser will no longer process the
                attributionsrcattribute or the
                attributionReportingproperty in requests, it will no
                longer send these two headers on outgoing requests.

             +

                attribution-reportingpermission policy:
                Theattribution-reportingpermission policy
                
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/attribution-reporting-api/#permission-policy-integration&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/attribution-reporting-api/#permission-policy-integration&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;will
                be removed along with the API. Since the API it
                controls will no longer exist, the permission policy
                will have no effect and its removal is not considered
                a breaking change.



    Planning and Estimated Milestones

    Deprecate the browser API surface in M144 and remove in M150.


    There will be one aspect of ARA that will end sooner. Server-side
    summary report computation will no longer operate by late
    December 2025. We have already communicated to the users of that
    service of these plans. Such users can use debug reports instead
    until the removal of the ARA surface as a whole. Since this
    impacts post-facto server-side operations, it will not incur any
    user-facing breakage.


    Currently ~20%
    &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/webfeature/timeline/popularity/282&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/webfeature/timeline/popularity/282&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;of
    page loads use the Attribution Reporting API. While ARA’s usage
    as a percentage of page loads is quite high, it is driven by a
    small number of third-party ad tech scripts present on a large
    number of sites. We will continue to monitor usage in addition to
    providing comprehensive updates on privacysandbox.google.com
    &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.google.com/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.google.com/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;with the status of the API
    and deprecation plans

    We will proactively work toward reducing ARA usage to low levels
    once this intent is approved, including disallowing any new
    enrollment sign-ups, and contacting enrolled sites to inform them
    about the deprecation timelines.

&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Part of the reason that I think that we can remove the other &#38;quot;privacy 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;sandbox&#38;quot; features so aggressively despite high usage numbers, is that 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;the number of actual users is very limited. I don&#39;t have the 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;understanding necessary to say if that is true for this one as well.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Or in other words, do you know how realistic it is to drive this to a 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;really, really, minute usage number through a deprecation?
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;I am also more worried about the effect of breaking this compared to 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;some of the others. It seems more likely to actually cause site 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;breakage, if (I don&#39;t know this) it is used more widely than the other APIs.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

Do you know more about those concerns?

        Summary

&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;The Shared Storage API is a privacy-preserving web API to enable 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;storage that is not partitioned by first-party site.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Following Chrome&#39;s announcement

Motivation

&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Chrome has announced 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;that 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;the current approach to third-party cookies will be maintained. Given 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;this, we expect adoption to decrease over time (currently at ~11% 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4263&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4263&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;of 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;page loads) as the main use cases for Shared Storage will remain 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;possible in Chrome using third-party cookies. Further, other browser 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;engines have not signaled interest in launching the API. See also the 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;initial public proposal below.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;



Developer-facing impact

&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;Sites that are using the Shared Storage API that do not migrate to 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;alternative solutions may experience a disruption in functionality, 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;and in particular all writes, reads, and worklet operations will fail. 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;If continued usage numbers warrant, we will take steps to minimize any 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;risk of actual page breakage, e.g. by temporarily retaining stub 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;implementations of the window-exposed methods that are still being 
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;tt&#38;gt;called most frequently.
&#38;lt;/tt&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;


The following API surfaces will be removed:

    All of the Shared Storage JavaScript functions exposed to the

    be removed. Since the worklet operation methods
    (`sharedStorage.run()` and `sharedStorage.selectURL()` listed
    above) will be removed or replaced with no-op stub
    implementations, there will be no calls to any
    SharedStorageWorklet-exposed Shared Storage JavaScript functions,
    and so removing them will cause no breakage.

 *

    The SharedStorageWorklet interface will be removed or replaced by
    a stub worklet interface (potentially for `addModule`, `run`,
    `selectURL` stub implementations).

 *

    Consequently the `sharedStorage.worklet` attribute will either be
    removed or updated to the stub worklet interface type pending removal.

 *

    The `sharedStorage.context` attribute will be removed, along with
    the related `setSharedStorageContext()` method on fenced frame
    configs. We will measure the usage of `setSharedStorageContext()`
    to determine whether it should be replaced with a no-op stub
    implementation instead.

 *

    The `sharedstoragewritable` attribute on &#38;lt;iframe&#38;gt; and &#38;lt;img&#38;gt;
    elements will be ignored.

 *

    The `sharedStorageWritable` option in the fetch() API&#39;s
    RequestInit will be a no-op.

 *

    Consequently, the `Sec-Shared-Storage-Writable` and
    `Sec-Shared-Storage-Data-Origin` request headers will no longer be
    sent, and the `Shared-Storage-Write` and
    `Shared-Storage-Cross-Origin-Worklet-Allowed` response headers
    will no longer be honored.

 *

    The “shared-storage” and “shared-storage-select-url” permissions
    policy-controlled features will be removed along with the APIs.
    Since the APIs they control will no longer exist, the permission
    policies will have no effect and their removal is not considered a
    breaking change.

 *

    The `sharedStorage` attribute on the Window will be removed once
    all stub implementations are no longer needed and are removed.

                Summary


                The Protected Audience API provides a method of
                interest-group advertising without third-party cookies
                or user tracking across sites.


        Following Chrome&#39;s announcement
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-next-steps/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-next-steps/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;that
        the current approach to third-party cookies will be
        maintained, we are now planning to deprecate and remove

        Web Feature ID

        None


        Motivation

        Chrome has announced that the current approach to third-party
        cookies will be maintained. Since that announcement there has
        been virtually no interest in the Protected Audience API. Use
        of the joinAdInterestGroup() API
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3855&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3855&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;has
        decreased by almost 100x and use of the runAdAuction() API
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3857&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3857&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;has
        decreased by more than 10x. Of the auctions occurring today,
        virtually none of them have winners (determined by looking at
        the “Success” bucket count of the
        Ads.InterestGroup.Auction.Result UMA), implying that they are
        not providing useful benefit to the pages initiating them.


        Initial public proposal

        
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
        
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.


        Developer-facing impact

        Given that virtually none of the Protected Audience auctions
        occurring today have winners, we estimate the lost utility
        from this removal to be negligible.


        User-facing risks

        The user-facing risks are small. While removing the JavaScript
        API could cause pages to break, the impact should be limited
        to sites that don&#39;t employ standard defensive coding or
        feature detection, which should be rare since not all browsers
        implement the API.


        If usage warrants, we will take steps to avoid any risk of
        page breakage, e.g. by temporarily retaining a stub
        implementation of Navigator APIs joinAdInterestGroup(),
        runAdAuction(), leaveAdInterestGroup(),
        clearOriginJoinedAdInterestGroups(),
        getInterestGroupAdAuctionData(),
        canLoadAdAuctionFencedFrame(), createAuctionNonce(),
        updateAdInterestGroups(),
        protectedAudience.queryFeatureSupport(),
        deprecatedReplaceInURN(), deprecatedURNtoURL(), and
        adAuctionComponents() that mimic current behavior when a user
        has disabled Protected Audience.


                Estimated milestones

        Planning to deprecate in M144 and remove in M150.

        page loads use the Protected Audience API. These are driven by
        a small number of third-party ad tech scripts present on a
        large number of sites. We will continue to monitor usage as
        well as provide comprehensive updates on
        privacysandbox.google.com

        We will also proactively work toward reducing usage to low
        levels once this intent is approved, including disallowing any
        new enrollment sign-ups, and contacting enrolled sites to
        inform them about the deprecation timelines.

    LGTM1 to deprecate. The plan to keep deprecation for 6 milestones
    also sounds good. Please come back after to this thread at a time
    when you think the removal can proceed. Since the amount of page
    loads is extremely high, we would like to reserve the right to
    pause the removal if this amount of page loads does not decrease
    substantially.

        Specification

        &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://patcg-individual-drafts.github.io/topics/&#34;&#38;gt;https://patcg-individual-drafts.github.io/topics/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

        Summary

        The Topics API is a privacy-preserving web API to enable
        ad-targeting based on a person’s general browsing interests,
        without exposing their exact browsing history.


        Following Chrome&#39;s announcement that the current approach to
        third-party cookies will be maintained, we are now planning to
        deprecate and remove the Topics API (along with other Privacy
        Sandbox APIs).


        The following API surfaces will be affected:

         *

            The JavaScript function `document.browsingTopics()` will
            be removed.

         *

            The `browsingtopics` attribute on &#38;lt;iframe&#38;gt; and &#38;lt;img&#38;gt;
            elements will be ignored.

         *

            The `browsingTopics` option in the fetch() API&#39;s
            RequestInit will be a no-op.

         *

            Consequently, the `Sec-Browsing-Topics` request header
            will no longer be sent, and the `Observe-Browsing-Topics`
            response header will no longer be honored.

         *

            The &#38;quot;browsing-topics&#38;quot; and &#38;quot;interest-cohort&#38;quot; permissions
            policy features will be removed.

        Web Feature ID

        None


        Motivation

        Chrome has announced that the current approach to third-party
        cookies will be maintained. Given this, we expect adoption to
        decrease over time (currently at 13%
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/5102&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/5102&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;of
        page loads) as interest based advertising will remain possible
        in Chrome using third-party cookies. Further, other browser
        engines have not signaled interest in launching the API. See
        also the initial public proposal below.

        Possible breakage

        Sites that rely on Topics API for targeting will experience
        utility impact.


        If usage warrants, we will take steps to avoid any risk of
        page breakage, e.g. by temporarily retaining a stub
        implementation of `document.browsingTopics()` that mimics
        current behavior when a user has no topics to return. However,
        since Topics is not enabled by default for all users, sites
        should already be using feature detection, which makes the
        risks of breakage low.


        Debuggability

        N/A


        Requires code in //chrome?

        True


        Estimated milestones

        Deprecate in M144 and then remove in M150.


        Currently, ~13%
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/5102&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/5102&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;of
        page loads use Topics API. These are driven by a small number
        of third-party ad tech scripts present on a large number of
        sites. We will continue to monitor usage as well as provide
        comprehensive updates on privacysandbox.google.com
        &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://goo.gle/ps-status&#34;&#38;gt;http://goo.gle/ps-status&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;with the status of the API and
        deprecation plans.


        We will also proactively work toward reducing usage to a low
        level once the intent is approved, including disallowing any
        new enrollment sign-ups, and contacting all enrolled sites
        that use the Privacy Sandbox APIs to inform them about the
        deprecation timelines.

&#38;gt; No unfortunately we did not do it at the time. Now it&#39;s clear we really
&#38;gt; need to do it.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adds the JavaScript type SharedArrayBuffer gated behind COOP/COEP. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; concept of a SharedArrayBuffer is that a message to a worker, is posted but
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; instead of copying the content of the array just a reference to it is
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; shared. The Atomic API provides atomic loads and stores and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Read/Modify/Write accesses to SharedArrayBuffers. The Atomic.wait provides
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the ability for a worker to wait for another worker to signal it, without
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; having to spinlock.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *No information provided*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Reason this experiment is being extended*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This is a deprecation trial, and we&#39;re giving more time to websites to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; stop using the deprecated behavior.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Reason this experiment is being extended*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The release of DocumentIsolationPolicy in M137 is helping developers
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; adopt crossOriginIsolation as a way out of this reverse Origin Trial.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; However, it will still take time for developers to adopt. We would like to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; extend the OT as the final extension and give developers 6 milestones to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; get out of this reverse Origin Trial. Once this is approved and developers
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; have requested their token, we will close this trial so that no further
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; origins adopt the deprecated behavior.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Reason this experiment is being extended*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We still have one of the historic users of ungated SharedArrayBuffers
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which has not managed to transition to cross-origin isolation (Google
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Earth). They are in the process of deploying COEP and asked us for an
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; extension of the reverse origin trial until M146, when they believe they
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; will be done with COEP deployment. Once the extension is approved, we&#39;ll
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; close the Origin Trial to ensure no new users can register.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; we discussed closing new registrations and only allowing exiting
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; registrations to renew. Was this ever set up? (if so, it seems to have
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; regressed, from what I can tell).

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Thank you for raising this issue.

We&#39;ve already reached out to folks representing 99% of the remaining Shared
Storage API calls, and will reach out to the rest soon. We&#39;re confident
that we can remove this API by the proposed milestone with minimal user
breakage or utility loss.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; Part of the reason that I think that we can remove the other &#38;quot;privacy
&#38;gt; sandbox&#38;quot; features so aggressively despite high usage numbers, is that the
&#38;gt; number of actual users is very limited. I don&#39;t have the understanding
&#38;gt; necessary to say if that is true for this one as well.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Or in other words, do you know how realistic it is to drive this to a
&#38;gt; really, really, minute usage number through a deprecation?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; I am also more worried about the effect of breaking this compared to some
&#38;gt; of the others. It seems more likely to actually cause site breakage, if (I
&#38;gt; don&#39;t know this) it is used more widely than the other APIs.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Do you know more about those concerns?

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Summary
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The Shared Storage API is a privacy-preserving web API to enable storage
&#38;gt; that is not partitioned by first-party site.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Following Chrome&#39;s announcement
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-next-steps/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-next-steps/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that the
&#38;gt; current approach to third-party cookies will be maintained, we are now
&#38;gt; planning to deprecate and remove the Shared Storage API (along with certain
&#38;gt; other Privacy Sandbox APIs, as outlined on the Privacy Sandbox feature
&#38;gt; status page &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.google.com/overview/status&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.google.com/overview/status&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Interest in the Shared Storage API has decreased since the announcement. Use
&#38;gt; of sharedStorage.worklet.addModule()
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4264&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4264&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; has
&#38;gt; decreased ~20% from its peak of 7.35% of page loads down to 5.85% of page
&#38;gt; loads. Use of sharedStorage.createWorklet()
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4836&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4836&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; has
&#38;gt; decreased ~82% from 4.87% to 0.864% of page loads. Use of
&#38;gt; sharedStorage.run()
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4270&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4270&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; has
&#38;gt; decreased ~30%  from 5.28% to 3.71% of page loads. Use of
&#38;gt; sharedStorage.selectURL()
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4269&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4269&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; has
&#38;gt; decreased ~28% from 6.24% to 4.51% of page loads. Use of sharedStorage
&#38;gt; overall
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4263&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4263&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; has
&#38;gt; decreased ~9% from 11.91% of page loads  to 10.86% of page loads.

&#38;gt; Web Feature ID
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; None
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Motivation
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Chrome has announced
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#34;&#38;gt;https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; that the current approach to third-party cookies will be maintained. Given
&#38;gt; this, we expect adoption to decrease over time (currently at ~11%
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4263&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4263&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of
&#38;gt; page loads) as the main use cases for Shared Storage will remain possible
&#38;gt; in Chrome using third-party cookies. Further, other browser engines have
&#38;gt; not signaled interest in launching the API. See also the initial public
&#38;gt; proposal below.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Developer-facing impact
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Sites that are using the Shared Storage API that do not migrate to
&#38;gt; alternative solutions may experience a disruption in functionality, and in
&#38;gt; particular all writes, reads, and worklet operations will fail. If
&#38;gt; continued usage numbers warrant, we will take steps to minimize any risk of
&#38;gt; actual page breakage, e.g. by temporarily retaining stub implementations of
&#38;gt; the window-exposed methods that are still being called most frequently.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; The following API surfaces will be removed:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    All of the Shared Storage JavaScript functions exposed to the Window
&#38;gt;    
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/shared-storage/blob/main/README.md#outside-of-worklets-eg-places-where-writing-can-happen&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/shared-storage/blob/main/README.md#outside-of-worklets-eg-places-where-writing-can-happen&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    will be removed or replaced with stub implementations:
&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;       `window.sharedStorage.worklet.addModule()`
&#38;gt;       -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;       `window.sharedStorage.createWorklet()`
&#38;gt;       -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;       `window.sharedStorage.worklet.run()`/`sharedStorage.run()`
&#38;gt;       -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;       `window.sharedStorage.worklet.selectURL()`/`sharedStorage.selectURL()`
&#38;gt;       -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;       `window.sharedStorage.set()`
&#38;gt;       -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;       `window.sharedStorage.append()`
&#38;gt;       -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;       `window.sharedStorage.delete()`
&#38;gt;       -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;       `window.sharedStorage.clear()`
&#38;gt;       -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;       `window.sharedStorage.batchUpdate()`
&#38;gt;       -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    All of the Shared Storage JavaScript functions exposed only to the
&#38;gt;    SharedStorageWorklet
&#38;gt;    
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/shared-storage/blob/main/README.md#in-the-worklet-during-an-operation&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/shared-storage/blob/main/README.md#in-the-worklet-during-an-operation&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    will be removed. Since the worklet operation methods (`sharedStorage.run()`
&#38;gt;    and `sharedStorage.selectURL()` listed above) will be removed or replaced
&#38;gt;    with no-op stub implementations, there will be no calls to any
&#38;gt;    SharedStorageWorklet-exposed Shared Storage JavaScript functions, and so
&#38;gt;    removing them will cause no breakage.
&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    The SharedStorageWorklet interface will be removed or replaced by a
&#38;gt;    stub worklet interface (potentially for `addModule`, `run`, `selectURL`
&#38;gt;    stub implementations).
&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    Consequently the `sharedStorage.worklet` attribute will either be
&#38;gt;    removed or updated to the stub worklet interface type pending removal.
&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    The `sharedStorage.context` attribute will be removed, along with the
&#38;gt;    related `setSharedStorageContext()` method on fenced frame configs. We will
&#38;gt;    measure the usage of `setSharedStorageContext()` to determine whether it
&#38;gt;    should be replaced with a no-op stub implementation instead.
&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    The `sharedstoragewritable` attribute on &#38;lt;iframe&#38;gt; and &#38;lt;img&#38;gt; elements
&#38;gt;    will be ignored.
&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    The `sharedStorageWritable` option in the fetch() API&#39;s RequestInit
&#38;gt;    will be a no-op.
&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    Consequently, the `Sec-Shared-Storage-Writable` and
&#38;gt;    `Sec-Shared-Storage-Data-Origin` request headers will no longer be sent,
&#38;gt;    and the `Shared-Storage-Write` and
&#38;gt;    `Shared-Storage-Cross-Origin-Worklet-Allowed` response headers will no
&#38;gt;    longer be honored.
&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    The “shared-storage” and “shared-storage-select-url” permissions
&#38;gt;    policy-controlled features will be removed along with the APIs. Since the
&#38;gt;    APIs they control will no longer exist, the permission policies will have
&#38;gt;    no effect and their removal is not considered a breaking change.
&#38;gt;    -
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;    The `sharedStorage` attribute on the Window will be removed once all
&#38;gt;    stub implementations are no longer needed and are removed.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Estimated milestones
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Planning to deprecate in M144 and remove in M150.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Currently, ~11%
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4263&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4263&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of
&#38;gt; page loads use Shared Storage API. While this usage is quite high for a
&#38;gt; deprecation and removal, it is driven by a small number of third-party ad

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hi all,

We&#39;re making a change in Supplementable&#38;lt;T&#38;gt; (and Supplement&#38;lt;T&#38;gt;) to remove it;
we already changed it from a hash table to a simple array underneath,
with good size gains (and a small Speedometer3 gain from the single hottest
member).&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

For members where there is no layering violation, we&#39;ll simply
forward-declare the class in the .h file and have a Member&#38;lt;&#38;gt;,
along with a getter and setter.

For members where we cannot do that (e.g. Document, in, core/document.h,
wants to have a Member&#38;lt;RTCPeerConnectionController&#38;gt;, which is defined
in modules/peerconnection/rtc_peer_connection_controller.h, and core/
cannot #include anything from modules/) we&#39;ll instead use the new
ForwardDeclaredMember&#38;lt;&#38;gt; which has almost the same ergonomics but
under-the-hood Trace()s via a vtable pointer like Supplement&#38;lt;&#38;gt; does today.

There&#39;s going to be a bunch of new getters and setters (and Members)
showing up, but they already existed through template magic; they are
just becoming visible now and given names and types (as opposed to being
string-keyed, which risks type confusion). We expect a tiny further
decrease in binary size and no significant change in compilation time.

Example CL:

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;While I share Alex&#39;s general concern (see
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3ctag/design-principles/issues/426#issuecomment-3824607888&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3ctag/design-principles/issues/426#issuecomment-3824607888&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;),
I tend to agree that the I2S is not the right place for this debate.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Seeing no open issues for the API on the spec / PR, and reading TAG&#39;s
guidance that adding APIs on the global is at least sometimes reasonable, I
don&#39;t personally think API owners are in a position to block on this.

LGTM4 once the PR lands.

&#38;gt; Hmm, I&#39;m a bit surprised to have this discussion here on the I2S rather
&#38;gt; than on the design-principles thread, trying to drive consensus there. I
&#38;gt; honestly think for this API it&#39;s best to proceed with the LGTMs and current
&#38;gt; feedback we&#39;ve got from existing editors, TAG, and (informally) other
&#38;gt; browsers, and re-litigate the `window` vs `navigator` discussion with the
&#38;gt; TAG to the point of consensus, so we can avoid further instances of
&#38;gt; confusion.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Let me be a bit more direct: it&#39;s a bad smell for us to be putting things

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Window or WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope is right for this, IMO. I think
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope would be better, but right now the Crash
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Reporting infrastructure (beyond this API) only considers documents /
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RenderFrameHosts, and does not apply to Workers. I think this is a legacy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; artifact of how Crash Reporting was implemented a while back (it seems 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; old;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;ve only recently added to it). I can envision implementation and spec
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; changes in the future to cover Workers, in which case we could move the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to Window*OrWorkerGlobalScope* with little pain, but since the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; overall infra is not implemented for workers, putting the crashReport
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API there doesn&#39;t quite work at the moment.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; on `window`; was the TAG consulted?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Best,

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Actually, no. Possibly minor editorial things I need to wade
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; through, but otherwise no. I&#39;ll get on landing it.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I think it&#39;s probably fine not to block on WPT tests for landing
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this, but if Mozilla is (as you say) likely to start working on an
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation over the next year then I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;d

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; explore the feasibility of adding WPT infrastructure.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Right, this API is still a priority and staffed, so if such a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; signal comes in, getting all the WPT infrastructure worked out will 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; become
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a priority and something we will lead, since the utility will be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; clear.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A new key-value API, tentatively `window.crashReport`, backed by
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a per-Document map holding data that gets appended to crash 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; reports. See

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; discussion. The data placed in this API&#39;s backing map gets sent in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `CrashReportBody` [1] if any renderer process crashes are incurred 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; by the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; site. This lets developers debug what specific state in their 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; might be causing a given crash. [1]:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The Crash Reporting API (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#34;&#38;gt;https://wicg.github.io/crash-reporting/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; allows developers to know when their site is crashing in the wild, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; some very rudimentary information associated with each crash. But
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers don&#39;t have enough to go off to debug the crash further. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; allows developers to get a JavaScript stack trace, but only for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; unresponsive crashes. Outside of this narrow case, developers have 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a hard
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; time tying their specific logic or features to a real-world crash. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `window.crashReport` API exposes a light-weight key-value store that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers can use to store breadcrumbs of their app state, which 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; get
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appended to crash reports that get sent to their developer-specified
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; endpoints. This significantly helps developers pinpoint the cause 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; crash they&#39;re seeing in the wild, and radically speed up their

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; such that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; applications?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature could benefit by DevTools integration, to help
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers more ergonomically interact with data in the crash report
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; storage. We&#39;re considering this integration as a follow-up to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; support our
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; partners, in the first half of 2026.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature is not fully testable with Web Platform Tests,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; because WPT infrastructure does not provide the ability to crash 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specific
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; renderer processes. This limitation has not prevented the Crash

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Infrastructure from shipping in general, nor has it prevented 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; additions
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; like &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4731248572628992&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;. This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API will be tested with as many web platform tests as possible to

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation in Firefox to follow.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We expect the feature to be used by a very small number of large

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compat or interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolution may introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re considering ergonomic additions to the API in the near
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; future, such as: - The ability to retrieve keys placed in the crash 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; storage
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - The ability to reset the storage entirely (freeing it), and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; re-request a

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hi blink-dev,

In Chrome M146, we plan to enable the back/forward cache (BFCache) for
pages that use Shared Workers.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Previously, the usage of Shared Workers blocked pages from entering
BFCache. We have been experimenting with removing this restriction, and we
are now ready to enable this behavior by default.

With this change, pages holding a Shared Worker connection will be eligible
for BFCache. However, please be aware of the following eviction behaviors:

   - *Message from Worker*: If a page in BFCache receives a message from a
   Shared Worker, the page will be evicted.
   - *All connections cached*: If all pages connected to a Shared Worker
   enter BFCache, those pages will be evicted because the Shared Worker is no
   longer actively needed.

You can view the relevant HTML spec changes in this GitHub PR
&#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/12086&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/12086&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.

Separately, we are working on a change to freeze the Shared Worker and keep
storing the pages instead of evicting them when all connected pages are in
BFCache. We plan to start a Finch experiment for this behavior soon.

Thanks,
Anna

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Thanks for reviewing the intent, Alex.

Regarding unified behavior with RTCAudioSourceStats, I don&#39;t believe this
API serves the same goal. WebAudio’s stats are centered specifically around
audio stream quality, so I am unsure about achieving unified behavior
across these different APIs.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

As for getting similar stats from the &#38;lt;audio&#38;gt; element or WebRTC contexts,
both HTMLAudioElement and WebRTC&#39;s audio systems are &#38;quot;push-based.&#38;quot; By
design, they should not experience audio sample dropouts or glitches in the
same way. The WebAudio (pull-based) playback stats are specifically
designed to catch dropouts so developers can estimate the user&#39;s audio
quality and experience.

Hopefully this answers your question!

Best,
Hongchan

&#38;gt; Hey Hongchan,
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; This looks extremely useful!
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; I&#39;m a little surprised to see that the TAG didn&#39;t ask about alignment with
&#38;gt; other APIs in the space, e.g.:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;     &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats&#34;&#38;gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Will we get unified behaviour here? Will it be possible to get similar
&#38;gt; stats from an &#38;lt;audio&#38;gt; element or WebRTC contexts, e.g.?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Best,

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature adds an AudioContext.playbackStats attribute which returns
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; an AudioPlaybackStats object. This object provides audio playback
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; statistics such as average latency, minimum/maximum latency, underrun
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; duration, and underrun count. This API allows web applications to monitor
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; audio playout quality and detect glitches. Note: This feature was
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; previously tracked as AudioContext.playoutStats. It has been renamed to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; AudioContext.playbackStats to align with the final Web Audio API
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specification. The old name is supported as a deprecated alias for backward
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compatibility.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Blink component*

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; There is currently no way to detect whether WebAudio playout has glitches
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (gaps in the played audio, which typically happens due to underperformance
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the audio pipeline). There is an existing way to measure the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; instantaneous playout latency using AudioContext.outputLatency, but no
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; simple way to measure average/minimum/maximum latency over time. With this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API, we want to propose a way to be able to measure the delay of that audio
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and the glitchiness of the audio.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

With that, LGTM1.

    Why would scrapers opt into metrics reporting? Seems an unlikely

    from Edge histograms?

        Hi,

        Thanks for the questions. Find below my responses:

          * Question: As a non-CSS expert, can you help me better
            understand what &#38;quot;applying that special-case becomes
            ambiguous and difficult to define consistently&#38;quot;? Is this
            in terms of code that authors would write, or prose for
            spec authors? An example would be helpful here.
              o Answer: The ambiguity is primarily around spec
                semantics. Gap decorations extended the column-rule-*
                properties to accept value lists and `repeat()`
                patterns. The previous rule (“if style is none/hidden,
                then computed width is 0”) is straightforward for a
                single value, but with lists and repeats you no longer
                have a clean, well-defined way of expressing this
                behavior. For example, from the CSSWG discussion:
                  + column-rule-style: solid dashed none;
                  + column-rule-width: 1px 2px;
              o This cycles to: “1px solid, 2px dashed, (1px) none,
                2px solid, 1px dashed, (2px) none …”.
              o Setting the width to zero in this case depending on
                the style at any point in the expansion isn’t
                well-defined.
              o Also, `repeat()` syntax is preserved at computed-value
                time, which further prevents expanding lists and
                applying a clean index-based rule:
                  + column-rule-style: repeat(2, solid none dashed);
                  + column-rule-width: 1px 2px;
              o This would expand to: “1px (solid), 2px (none),
                1px(dashed), 2px(solid), 1px(none), 2px (dashed) …”
                But computed values explicitly do not perform this
                expansion, so any rule that depends on per-index
                alignment between style and width cannot be spec&#39;d in
                a well-defined way.
          * Question: 2.37% of page views is a lot of page views. Why
            do we feel confident that border-width needs backwards
            compat considerations for getComputedStyle but
            column-rule-width and outline-width don&#39;t? Are you saying
            that 2.37% of the use counters are coming from
            fingerprinting? I&#39;m also not sure what it means for a
            scraper to trigger a UseCounter - can you clarify? I&#39;ve
            typically thought of scraping as a server-side operation -
            are these web extensions?
              o Why do we feel confident that border-width needs
                backwards compat considerations for getComputedStyle
                and column-rule-width and outline-width don’t?
                  + `border-*-width` properties are more commonly used
                    and are tied to the box model, so changing what
                    getComputedStyle() returns is more likely to
                    affect existing scripts that compute geometry or
                    layout related behavior. In contrast,
                    outline-width and column-rule-width are less
                    commonly used and are only used for visual
                    decoration so returning the author-specified width
                    rather than 0px should not affect the element’s
                    geometry, making user-visible regressions less likely.
              o On the 2.37%
                  + The use counter added was scoped to trigger when
                    the resolved value gotten from getComputedStyle is
                    called on an element where style is none/hidden
                    but width is non-zero. While 2.37% is high we
                    believe the traffic is dominated by:
                      # Fingerprinting/Telemetry scripts that
                        typically iterate over every CSS property to
                        build a unique “fingerprint” of the browser.
                      # Generic serializers that read all styles to
                        copy/paste or inspect elements
                  + The default for these properties is *-width:
                    medium and *-style: none. This is also a
                    contributing factor to this high percentage. So
                    even if a site doesn’t explicitly set these values
                    and is being scraped, by virtue of the defaults,
                    the counter will get hit.
                  + On scrapers being server side
                      # In recent times, we’ve seen scrapers be
                        headless browser automation like Puppeteer or
                        Selenium or client-side scripts in real
                        browsers. They can execute Javascript and call
                        getComputedStyle which in this case would
                        expect the counter to be hit.
                        These tools often query hundreds of properties
                        which signals that a high query rate does not
                        necessarily imply meaningful web-facing
                        dependence on the current behavior.
                  + Also, we are not first movers in this case, Webkit
                    and Gecko have shipped this.

            property, such as ‘border-style’, was set to ‘none’ or
            ‘hidden’, the computed ‘*-width’, such as ‘border-width’,
            would resolve to ‘0px’, even if the width was explicitly
            set to ‘10px’. Following a resolution in the CSSWG [1],
            the computed values of ‘border-width’, ‘outline-width’,
            and ‘column-rule-width’ will now reflect their specified
            values, regardless of the associated style property&#39;s
            value. Similarly, the resolved values of ‘outline-width’,
            and ‘column-rule-width’ will now reflect their specified
            values, regardless of the associated style property&#39;s
            value. [1]:

            *Web Feature ID*
            /No information provided/

            *Motivation*
            Today, CSS special-cases ‘border-*-width’,
            ‘outline-width’, and ‘column-rule-width’ so that their
            computed value becomes ‘0px’ when the corresponding
            ‘*-style’ is ‘none’ or ‘hidden’, even if the author
            specified a nonzero width. With Gap Decorations extending
            ‘column-rule-*’ properties to support lists/repeaters,
            applying that special-case becomes ambiguous and
            difficult to define consistently. Having ‘*-width’ values
            independent of ‘*-style’, provides an intuitive model for
            these properties and better reflects the author-specified
            value.
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/blockquote&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

            As a non-CSS expert, can you help me better understand
            what &#38;quot;applying that special-case becomes ambiguous and
            difficult to define consistently&#38;quot;? Is this in terms of
            code that authors would write, or prose for spec authors?
            An example would be helpful here.

            *Risks*


            *Interoperability and Compatibility*
            The interoperability risk is low as both Gecko and Webkit
            have already implemented these changes. Compatibility
            risk is also low. The resolved value for `border-width`
            via `getComputedStyle()` will remain 0px when
            `border-style` is set to `none`/ `hidden`, maintaining
            backward compatibility. For `outline-width` and
            `column-rule-width`, both computed and resolved values
            will show the specified values, as these properties are
            rarely queried and unlikely to impact existing content.
            To support the claim, we collected UseCounter data
            measuring how often these values are queried. The
            computed‑value counters for these properties are
            extremely low (&#38;lt;0.0001%). The resolved‑value counters for
            ‘column-rule-width’ and ‘outline-width’ show ~2.37%
            usage, which reflects calls to ‘getComputedStyle()’
            rather than observable rendering usage. Since
            ‘getComputedStyle()’ is frequently queried by automated
            tooling (e.g. scrapers and fingerprinting scripts) that
            do not depend on property semantics, this usage does not
            indicate meaningful web‑facing reliance. As a result, the
            compatibility risk remains low.
&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/blockquote&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre style=&#34;margin: 0em;&#34;&#38;gt;

            2.37% of page views is a lot of page views. Why do we feel
            confident that border-width needs backwards compat
            considerations for getComputedStyle but column-rule-width
            and outline-width don&#39;t? Are you saying that 2.37% of the
            use counters are coming from fingerprinting? I&#39;m also not
            sure what it means for a scraper to trigger a UseCounter -
            can you clarify? I&#39;ve typically thought of scraping as a
            server-side operation - are these web extensions?

            thanks!

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api/pull/294&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api/pull/294&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; A bit more details would be useful here. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; Even reading through 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api?tab=readme-ov-file#precommit-handlers&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api?tab=readme-ov-file#precommit-handlers&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the role of post-commit handlers, nor how does one define them today is not 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; clear. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; I *think* I have a vague idea, so let me try to take a stab and let me 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; know if I got it right. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; Currently a developer that wants to add a post-commit handler (or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; simply a `handler` in the current API) to e.g. send analytics that a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; navigation has happened, can do that using 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ``` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; if (e.canIntercept) { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; const handler = sendAnalytics(e); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; e.intercept({ handler }); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; }); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ``` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; When they want to do something pre-commit (e.g. cancel the navigation 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if the target URL doesn&#39;t lead to a cat video), they can do something like 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ``` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; if (e.canIntercept) { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; const precommitHandler = verifyCatVideo(controller); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; e.intercept({ precommitHandler }); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; }); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ``` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; They can even add both. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; But when developers today want to add a post-commit (or &#38;quot;regular&#38;quot;) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; handler as a result of some handler in the pre-commit, they have no way of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; doing that. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; This proposal is to add an `addHandler` method to the precommit 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; controller, that would enable to add such post-commit handlers. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; Is that roughly accurate? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes! 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; If so, what would be an example use-case of wanting to add a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; post-commit handler as a result of pre-commit logic? What information does 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the pre-commit handler have that a post-commit logic doesn&#39;t? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Something like this, where the precommit handler performs some logic 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to understand what to do with the request, and perhaps begins some 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sort of shell, to be later populated by the handler: 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ```js 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if (e.canIntercept) { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; e.intercept({ 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; async precommitHandler(controller) { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if (should_redirect(e.destination.url)) [ 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; e.redirect(new_url); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; return; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; else if (should_cancel(destination.url)) { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; throw new Error(&#38;quot;cancel this navigation&#38;quot;); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; const contentPromise = fetchPageData(); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; const shell = await fetchPageShell(); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; shell.show_skeleton(); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; controller.addHandler(() =&#38;gt; show_actual_data(await contentPromise)); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; }); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ``` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Doing it this way is slightly more ergonomic than managing promises 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; outside of the intercept call.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; A bit more details would be useful here. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; Even reading through 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api?tab=readme-ov-file#precommit-handlers&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api?tab=readme-ov-file#precommit-handlers&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the role of post-commit handlers, nor how does one define them today is not 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; clear. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; I *think* I have a vague idea, so let me try to take a stab and let me 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; know if I got it right. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; Currently a developer that wants to add a post-commit handler (or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; simply a `handler` in the current API) to e.g. send analytics that a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; navigation has happened, can do that using 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ``` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; if (e.canIntercept) { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; const handler = sendAnalytics(e); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; e.intercept({ handler }); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; }); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ``` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; When they want to do something pre-commit (e.g. cancel the navigation 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if the target URL doesn&#39;t lead to a cat video), they can do something like 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ``` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; if (e.canIntercept) { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; const precommitHandler = verifyCatVideo(controller); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; e.intercept({ precommitHandler }); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; }); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ``` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; They can even add both. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; But when developers today want to add a post-commit (or &#38;quot;regular&#38;quot;) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; handler as a result of some handler in the pre-commit, they have no way of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; doing that. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; This proposal is to add an `addHandler` method to the precommit 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; controller, that would enable to add such post-commit handlers. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; Is that roughly accurate? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Yes! 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; If so, what would be an example use-case of wanting to add a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; post-commit handler as a result of pre-commit logic? What information does 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the pre-commit handler have that a post-commit logic doesn&#39;t? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Something like this, where the precommit handler performs some logic 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to understand what to do with the request, and perhaps begins some 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sort of shell, to be later populated by the handler: 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ```js 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if (e.canIntercept) { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; e.intercept({ 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; async precommitHandler(controller) { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if (should_redirect(e.destination.url)) [ 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; e.redirect(new_url); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; return; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; else if (should_cancel(destination.url)) { 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; throw new Error(&#38;quot;cancel this navigation&#38;quot;); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; const contentPromise = fetchPageData(); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; const shell = await fetchPageShell(); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; shell.show_skeleton(); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; controller.addHandler(() =&#38;gt; show_actual_data(await contentPromise)); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; } 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; }); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ``` 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Doing it this way is slightly more ergonomic than managing promises 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; outside of the intercept call.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hi Alex --
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The OT we are requesting an extension for is just the ability for sites 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to temporarily opt-out of the secure contexts requirement, which was 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; included as part of our original Intent-to-Ship for Local Network Access 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/cwu_RUmBpzY/m/hk8YuZDWHgAJ&#34;&#38;gt;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/cwu_RUmBpzY/m/hk8YuZDWHgAJ&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The same opt-out applies to the followup work we are doing to apply LNA 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; restrictions to WebSockets (planned for M147), so we want to extend the OT 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to serve as a temporary solution for mixed content issues that developers 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; might run into during that rollout.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This bit from our original I2S might help clarify:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;gt; This permission is restricted to secure contexts. If granted, the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; permissions additionally relaxes mixed content blocking for local network 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; requests (since many local devices are not able to obtain publicly trusted 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; TLS certificates). Requests from insecure contexts will be silently 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rejected. Sites may temporarily opt-out of the secure contexts restriction 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; using the reverse origin trial “Local Network Access from Non-Secure 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Contexts 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/3826370833404657665&#34;&#38;gt;https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/3826370833404657665&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;”,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; included in this launch.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Sorry for any confusion from the automated email from ChromeStatus! I 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; know there are a lot of different moving parts for our rollout of LNA.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hey Chris,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; There was some confusion this morning about this Intent in API OWNERS. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A couple of things would be helpful to tease out (and apologies if they&#39;re 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; obvious to you; they weren&#39;t to us):
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  - This is being phrased as an extension, however it seems that the API 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; shape is changing too (the new permission policy name). Ordinarily, we&#39;d 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; just approve something like that because it would likely be a breaking 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; change, but it sounds like care is being taken not to break OT users here. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Why?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  - Is it correct to say that this is both a deprecation (of the local 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; network connection behaviour) and a new feature (the new permissions)? If 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; so, how do you suggest the API OWNERS think about what sort of risk we&#39;re 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; taking on?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  - What&#39;s the tlimeline for removal/ship (depending on answer to the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; previous question)?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Best,

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Chrome 142 restricted the ability to make requests to the user&#39;s local 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; network, gated behind a permission prompt. A local network request is any 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; request from a public website to a local IP address or loopback, or from 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; local website (for example, intranet) to loopback. Gating the ability for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; websites to perform these requests behind a permission mitigates the risk 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of cross-site request forgery attacks against local network devices such 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; as 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; routers, and reduces the ability of sites to use these requests to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fingerprint the user&#39;s local network. This permission is restricted to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; secure contexts. If granted, the permissions additionally relaxes mixed 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; content blocking for local network requests (since many local devices are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; not able to obtain publicly trusted TLS certificates for various 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; reasons).

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; preflight requests to have local devices opt-in. For more information on

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;br&#38;gt; Chrome 145 introduces more granular permissions for websites 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; requesting access to a user&#39;s local network. The previous single 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `local-network-access permission` is being split into two distinct 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; permissions: * `local-network`: Grants access to IP addresses in the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; local 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; network space (for example, intranets, internal devices). * 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `loopback-network`: Grants access to loopback IP addresses (for example., 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`). The old `local-network` permission will remain 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; as an alias, ensuring existing configurations and Permissions Policies 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; continue to function as expected. This change provides both users and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Admins with more precise control over how websites interact with internal 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; network resources. Current enterprise policies managing local network 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; access will not be affected by this change.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Interoperability risks: LNA requires a Secure Context to make local 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; network requests, but exempts some of these local network requests from 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mixed content checks (if the user grants permission). If another browser 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; does not implement LNA, these same local network requests might be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; blocked 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; as mixed content, or the site might need to serve over HTTPS for Chrome 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; over HTTP for browsers that don&#39;t implement LNA (to avoid triggering 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mixed 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; content). Compatibility risks: There are some local network requests 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; types 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that we cannot know ahead of time will be going to the local network 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (e.g., 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a subresource request to &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://test.example&#34;&#38;gt;http://test.example&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; which then resolves to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 192.168.0.1). These would be blocked as mixed content, as mixed content 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; checks happen before hostname resolution (i.e., they occur before &#38;quot;Obtain 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; connection&#38;quot; in Fetch). Explicit local IP addresses, `.local` domains, and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fetch() requests with the new `targetAddressSpace` fetch() option are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; exempted from mixed content checks, but other connection types may be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; difficult for developers (e.g., WebSockets 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access/issues/16&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access/issues/16&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We hope that our Dev Trial will help identify compatibility issues. When 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; we 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fully ship we also plan on running a reverse origin trial to allow sites 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (temporarily) opt-out of the secure contexts requirement -- this would be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; an escape hatch for mixed content.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Feedback 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; from developers has been mixed, both due the new burden of a permission 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; prompt (compared to PNA) and from some of the difficulty of navigating 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mixed content (the same as PNA). Many developers understand the reasoning 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; behind adding the new permission though, and are productively engaging on 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; how they can avoid issues.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Other signals*: Brave ships a &#38;quot;localhost access&#38;quot; permission (see 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://brave.com/privacy-updates/27-localhost-permission/&#34;&#38;gt;https://brave.com/privacy-updates/27-localhost-permission/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Activation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A new permission will be shown to users, which may be unexpected, and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if users deny the permission functionality may break (potentially 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; requiring 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; additional support from site owners). Part of our goal for having a Dev 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Trial is to give site owners time to adjust their requests (especially if 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; they need to use the mixed content exemptions) and to potentially adapt 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; their UX flows so the permission requests are less surprising to users.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Exempting some requests from mixed content checks based on declared 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; targetAddressSpace could potentially be used to arbitrarily bypass mixed 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; content. To avoid this, LNA does an additional check that the actual 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolved address space matches what was declared, and blocks the request 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; it does not.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Launch of Local Network Access restrictions for WebSockets has been 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; delayed from M144 to M147 due to holidays and enterprise concerns. We&#39;d 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; like to push back the end date of this origin trial to allow for those 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; running WebSockets on HTTP endpoints currently to opt out of the secure 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; context restrictions for a period of time while they migrate to a secure 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; context

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; When a request would be blocked under LNA, we add a new DevTools Issue 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with details. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; No 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Android WebView currently doesn&#39;t support letting apps grant any new 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; permission types, so the Local Network Access permission is currently 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; unconditionally granted in WebView. Android is separately adding a Local 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Network permission which would apply to the app that embeds a WebView

                *Summary*
                Adds support for JSON and style module types as &#38;lt;link
                rel=&#38;quot;modulepreload&#38;quot;&#38;gt; destinations. &#38;lt;link
                rel=&#38;quot;modulepreload&#38;quot;&#38;gt; is already supported in Chromium
                (see &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5762805915451392&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5762805915451392&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

                but it currently only supports preloading script-like
                module scripts. This feature addresses a functionality
                gap, as JSON and CSS module scripts are supported in
                Chromium elsewhere but are not supported as &#38;lt;link
                rel=&#38;quot;modulepreload&#38;quot;&#38;gt; destinations.

                *Motivation*
                Style and JSON are fully supported as modules in
                Chromium (see
                &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
                &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and
                &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5749863620804608&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5749863620804608&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
                &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5749863620804608&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5749863620804608&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt;),
                but &#38;lt;link rel=modulepreload&#38;gt; only supports preloading
                script modules. This feature addresses a gap in the
                platform. In addition, supporting &#38;quot;style&#38;quot; as a
                modulepreload destination addresses a pain point
                identified when using external files with Declarative

                *Ergonomics*
                This feature will increase ergonomics with CSS Module
                Scripts (see
                &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

                and Declarative CSS Module Scripts (see
                &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4790543041298432&#34;&#38;gt;https://chromestatus.com/feature/4790543041298432&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

                No known ergonomics risks.

                *Activation*
                No polyfill is necessary, as a module import will
                succeed regardless of whether it&#39;s preloaded or not.
                In unsupported browsers, it will do nothing.

                *Security*
                No security risks.

                *WebView application risks*

                /Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of
                existing APIs, such that it has potentially high risk

                *Debuggability*
                Basic support via the Network tab in DevTools, which
                displays preloaded resources from this feature.

                *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink
                platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and
                Android WebView)?*

                This is not a new feature, just an expansion of an
                existing feature, so Finch is not necessary.

            we should land this change behind a feature flag, in case
            things go unexpectedly wrong. Can you do that?


                *Rollout plan*
                Will ship enabled for all users

                I plan on adding an additional UseCounter for style
                module preloads.

                *Estimated milestones*

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;I think the 2.37% use case is definitely interesting since if scrapers are 
causing this, I would expect the number to either be much higher (scrapers 
accessing this on most sites) or much lower (it&#39;s a negligible use case). &#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

That being said, I&#39;m also not convinced that these are &#38;quot;real developers&#38;quot; 
doing this on more than 2% of sites. 

Is it possible to check httparchive for a random sampling of websites that 
trigger this UMA and see if there is a pattern that emerges or whether 
there is script that accesses these properties?

In either case, in light of both Firefox and Safari shipping and the fact 
that outlines don&#39;t affect box geometry, I&#39;m inclined to approve with a 
note to be cautious in launching this and follow a finch rollout that 
propagates the feature to the stable channel slowly.

With that, LGTM1.

Also, it would be nice to follow up about the 2.37% to see if there is a 
solid explanation

Thanks,
Vlad

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hi,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thanks for the questions. Find below my responses:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - Question: As a non-CSS expert, can you help me better understand 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    what &#38;quot;applying that special-case becomes ambiguous and difficult to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; define 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    consistently&#38;quot;? Is this in terms of code that authors would write, or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; prose 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    for spec authors? An example would be helpful here.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - Answer: The ambiguity is primarily around spec semantics. Gap 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       decorations extended the column-rule-* properties to accept value 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lists and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       `repeat()` patterns. The previous rule (“if style is none/hidden, then 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       computed width is 0”) is straightforward for a single value, but with 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lists 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       and repeats you no longer have a clean, well-defined way of expressing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       behavior. For example, from the CSSWG discussion:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-style: solid dashed none;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-width: 1px 2px; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - This cycles to: “1px solid, 2px dashed, (1px) none, 2px solid, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       1px dashed, (2px) none …”. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - Setting the width to zero in this case depending on the style at 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       any point in the expansion isn’t well-defined.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - Also, `repeat()` syntax is preserved at computed-value time, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       which further prevents expanding lists and applying a clean 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; index-based 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       rule:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-style: repeat(2, solid none dashed);
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-width: 1px 2px;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - This would expand to: “1px (solid), 2px (none), 1px(dashed), 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       2px(solid), 1px(none), 2px (dashed) …” But computed values explicitly 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; do 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       not perform this expansion, so any rule that depends on per-index 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; alignment 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       between style and width cannot be spec&#39;d in a well-defined way.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - Question: 2.37% of page views is a lot of page views. Why do we 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    feel confident that border-width needs backwards compat considerations 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    getComputedStyle but column-rule-width and outline-width don&#39;t? Are you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    saying that 2.37% of the use counters are coming from fingerprinting? I&#39;m 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    also not sure what it means for a scraper to trigger a UseCounter - can 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    clarify? I&#39;ve typically thought of scraping as a server-side operation - 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    are these web extensions?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - Why do we feel confident that border-width needs backwards compat 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       considerations for getComputedStyle and column-rule-width and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; outline-width 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       don’t?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - `border-*-width` properties are more commonly used and are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          tied to the box model, so changing what getComputedStyle() returns 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is more 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          likely to affect existing scripts that compute geometry or layout 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; related 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          behavior. In contrast, outline-width and column-rule-width are less 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          commonly used and are only used for visual decoration so returning 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          author-specified width rather than 0px should not affect the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; element’s 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          geometry, making user-visible regressions less likely.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - On the 2.37%
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - The use counter added was scoped to trigger when the resolved 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          value gotten from getComputedStyle is called on an element where 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; style is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          none/hidden but width is non-zero. While 2.37% is high we believe 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          traffic is dominated by:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             - Fingerprinting/Telemetry scripts that typically iterate 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             over every CSS property to build a unique “fingerprint” of the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; browser.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             - Generic serializers that read all styles to copy/paste or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             inspect elements
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - The default for these properties is *-width: medium and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          *-style: none. This is also a contributing factor to this high 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; percentage. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          So even if a site doesn’t explicitly set these values and is being 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; scraped, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          by virtue of the defaults, the counter will get hit.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - On scrapers being server side
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             - In recent times, we’ve seen scrapers be headless browser 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             automation like Puppeteer or Selenium or client-side scripts in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; real 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             browsers. They can execute Javascript and call getComputedStyle 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             this case would expect the counter to be hit.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             These tools often query hundreds of properties which signals 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             that a high query rate does not necessarily imply meaningful 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; web-facing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             dependence on the current behavior.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - Also, we are not first movers in this case, Webkit and Gecko 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          have shipped this.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This proposal untangles ‘border-width’, ‘outline-width’, and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘column-rule-width’ from their corresponding ‘*-style’ properties. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Previously, if a ‘*-style’ property, such as ‘border-style’, was set to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘none’ or ‘hidden’, the computed ‘*-width’, such as ‘border-width’, would 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolve to ‘0px’, even if the width was explicitly set to ‘10px’. Following 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a resolution in the CSSWG [1], the computed values of ‘border-width’, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘outline-width’, and ‘column-rule-width’ will now reflect their specified 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; values, regardless of the associated style property&#39;s value. Similarly, the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolved values of ‘outline-width’, and ‘column-rule-width’ will now 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; reflect their specified values, regardless of the associated style 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; property&#39;s value. [1]:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Today, CSS special-cases ‘border-*-width’, ‘outline-width’, and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘column-rule-width’ so that their computed value becomes ‘0px’ when the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; corresponding ‘*-style’ is ‘none’ or ‘hidden’, even if the author specified 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a nonzero width. With Gap Decorations extending ‘column-rule-*’ properties 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to support lists/repeaters, applying that special-case becomes ambiguous 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and difficult to define consistently. Having ‘*-width’ values independent 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of ‘*-style’, provides an intuitive model for these properties and better 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; reflects the author-specified value. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; As a non-CSS expert, can you help me better understand what &#38;quot;applying 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that special-case becomes ambiguous and difficult to define consistently&#38;quot;? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Is this in terms of code that authors would write, or prose for spec 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authors? An example would be helpful here.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The interoperability risk is low as both Gecko and Webkit have already 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implemented these changes. Compatibility risk is also low. The resolved 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; value for `border-width` via `getComputedStyle()` will remain 0px when 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `border-style` is set to `none`/ `hidden`, maintaining backward 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compatibility. For `outline-width` and `column-rule-width`, both computed 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and resolved values will show the specified values, as these properties are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rarely queried and unlikely to impact existing content. To support the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; claim, we collected UseCounter data measuring how often these values are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; queried. The computed‑value counters for these properties are extremely low 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (&#38;lt;0.0001%). The resolved‑value counters for ‘column-rule-width’ and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘outline-width’ show ~2.37% usage, which reflects calls to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘getComputedStyle()’ rather than observable rendering usage. Since 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘getComputedStyle()’ is frequently queried by automated tooling (e.g. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; scrapers and fingerprinting scripts) that do not depend on property 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; semantics, this usage does not indicate meaningful web‑facing reliance. As 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a result, the compatibility risk remains low. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 2.37% of page views is a lot of page views. Why do we feel confident 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that border-width needs backwards compat considerations for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; getComputedStyle but column-rule-width and outline-width don&#39;t? Are you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; saying that 2.37% of the use counters are coming from fingerprinting? I&#39;m 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; also not sure what it means for a scraper to trigger a UseCounter - can you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; clarify? I&#39;ve typically thought of scraping as a server-side operation - 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; are these web extensions?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; thanks!

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;Hey all,

Thanks for the replies. I&#39;m mostly confused about how intently we need 
this. What applications does this improve? How? &#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Seeing a block of before/after example code that shows the problem in situ 
is usually how we get a minimal sense of how this will play out for 
customers. Not having that, and being asked to ship this first, raises the 
risk, particularly absent customers/developers telling us how this is going 
to make lives better.

Best,

Alex

&#38;gt; I think there is, but it is not pretty - calling 
&#38;gt; peerConnection.createOffer() will generate that SDP message and you can 
&#38;gt; parse it a bit to see if the data channel (m=application) shows up first 
&#38;gt; - that means the boolean worked.
&#38;gt; Of course, parsing the SDP is a pretty big hammer just for knowing whether 
&#38;gt; the boolean is supported...
&#38;gt; Looks like new RTCPeerConnection({alwaysNegotiateDataChannels: true}) 
&#38;gt; does not fail to create a peer connection at the moment, so unsupported 
&#38;gt; constraints cannot easily be feature-tested.
&#38;gt; Perhaps using a getter rather than a simple true ({get 
&#38;gt; alwaysNegotiateDataChannels() 
&#38;gt; { isConstraintSupported = true; return true; }}) would also work.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A potentially silly question, due to my complete ignorance of WebRTC 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; protocol negotiations:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; If I&#39;m planning to use this new boolean, that means that I may or may not 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; want to negotiate a data channel.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; If the other side doesn&#39;t support the boolean, I need to create a dummy 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; data channel. If it does, I don&#39;t need to create one.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But you&#39;re saying that I have no way of knowing up front if it&#39;s one or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the other.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; So how would developers know if they need to create a dummy channel? Is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; there some response to this boolean that indicates support or lack-thereof? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; If so, presumably it&#39;s not too late to create the dummy channel at that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; point?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Alex,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this boils down to WebRTCs notion that the &#38;quot;SDP&#38;quot; is a &#38;quot; blob&#38;quot;.  Which 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; makes the API look easy but from the amount of fighting over the plan-b 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; deprecation, &#38;quot;sdp munging&#38;quot; or even the question when inbound-rtp stats 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; appear, this is causing trouble since this &#38;quot;blob&#38;quot; controls a ton of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; behavior.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Developers can parse the SDP, e.g. like 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://jsfiddle.net/fippo/kct3dy46/&#34;&#38;gt;https://jsfiddle.net/fippo/kct3dy46/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which with the new option set should return [&#38;quot;application&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;video&#38;quot;] 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; instead of [&#38;quot;video&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;application&#38;quot;].
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The opt-in boolean avoids changing the default behavior so no surprises 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; unless you use it.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; If you opt in you also (implicitly) agree that you are ready to deal 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with the feature not being supported.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; So the other end that is parsing and processing the SDP you generate is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; today receiving
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   audio-video-data
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; without the opt-in and you ensure it works with
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   data-audio-video
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but you will still need to support the old way.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I am not worried about browsers where we deal with only two SDP parsers 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and both are well written robust enough to deal with.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This feature is only needed by the endpoint that creates the initial 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; offer and decides the m= section order, i.e. the other endpoint - 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; whether 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; they support this feature or not - will accept the m= section order that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; on offer. Once the order is decided, it is &#38;quot;locked in&#38;quot; by both 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; endpoints, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; as per old SDP rules. So it should be cross-browser compatible and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; backwards-compatible, here&#39;s me setting SDP with m= application line 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; first 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and the offer is accepted: &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://jsfiddle.net/henbos/oweu42yz/&#34;&#38;gt;https://jsfiddle.net/henbos/oweu42yz/&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; As for if the browser that is creating this offer supports the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature, you can feature detect by testing it on a throwaway 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RTCPeerConnection object that you immediately close afterwards.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Throwaway peerconnections are an antipattern too ;-)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Since RTCConfiguration is not exposed on window one can not feature 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; detect upfront but one can call pc.getConfiguration() to see if this had 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; an 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; effect after creating the connection and then adapt if necessary (i.e. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; create the not-quite-throwaway channel)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Not sure I would bother with feature detection, the other side should 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; support the resulting SDP both with the new behavior of datachannels 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; being 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; first or the current behavior so opt-in should be fine with fallback to

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Sorry, quick followup, keeping always in the name would make sense 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if it was explained that because this is negotiated first it ensures 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; we at least will always negotiate a data channel even if audio and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fail.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thank you for the explanation. I definitely agree that this sounds 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; very important. My concern remains that the parameter name and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developer documentation does not convey this and without this context 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; it&#39;s 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; unclear why I should use this. As an example, the config parameter 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; could 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; just be called negotiateDataChannels, as a cue that this will ensure 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; your 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; connection is configured to support creating data channels. It would 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; worth also explaining why you want to do this, with a short snippet 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; showing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; how a data channel can be added later.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Negotiating datachannels is already an overloaded term - the SDP 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiates support and datachannels themselves are negotiated in-band but 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; can also be negotiated out-of-band.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The spec says that it is negotiated before audio or video but 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; doesn&#39;t explain why you might want to do this - i.e. to ensure that 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you can 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiate a connection even if the audio or video channels fail to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiate a compatible codec.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; TLDR; I&#39;m not opposed to this feature - after learning what it 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; does and why, I agree we need it. I just think it would be very hard 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; someone reading about this to understand that they should use it to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolve 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; these issues.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The WebRTC samples &#38;lt;&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/webrtc/samples&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/webrtc/samples&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;&#38;gt; have always 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; been great for showing how a feature works but in this case even I have a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; hard time coming up with a good sample.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Adoption is more likely from opensource projects currently working 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; around this like MediaSoup and then it trickles down from there. Who 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; knows, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; maybe Google Meet might drive adoption just to get rid of the &#38;quot;ignored&#38;quot; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel ;-)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I have updated the description accordingly.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This simple API plugs a missing piece of functionality: there is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; no way to tell WebRTC that you may want to use data channels at some 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; point 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the future without having to re-negotiate, so the only way to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ensure you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiate data channels unconditionally is to create these dummy 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; data 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; channels not to be intended for use that you have to manually ignore 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; at the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; other endpoint, both with regards to events firing and when parsing 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; statistics.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Creating dummy data channels is a workaround to a mistake in the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API in my opinion, and I would support it even if all that it 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; achieved was 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API ergonomics.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But it does achieve something more than the workaround is able 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to: placing the m= application line at the top. The fact that the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; order of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; m= sections is more predictable reduces the risk of application 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; bugs. I 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; believe Google Meet had a serious regression a few years ago where 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the m= 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; section order was something not what we expected causing the SDP 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; parser to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fail and the call to be disconnected. It&#39;s also a good idea that the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; m= 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; application line gets tagged, avoiding risk of rejecting the whole 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; bundle 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; if the wrong m= section is rejected.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; change the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; connection?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Lets say you create a RTCPeerConnection. Create an offer and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; call setLocalDescription. Send it to your peer. You get an answer 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; from the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; peer and feed it into setRemoteDescription.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You might wonder why it does not result in a connection.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Next, you create a datachannel. Your datachannel never opens 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; because after adding the datachannel (only the first!) you need to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; call 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; createOffer/setLocalDescription and call setRemoteDescription with 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; answer.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;web developers&#38;quot; are notably confused:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79737908/how-do-i-create-a-data-channel-in-webrtc-js-firefox-115-6-esr&#34;&#38;gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79737908/how-do-i-create-a-data-channel-in-webrtc-js-firefox-115-6-esr&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now your connection gets established. If you add another data 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; channel you do *not* need to do this negotiation again (thankfully; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; adding 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; audio or video tracks requires negotiation).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In this case using the boolean flag is saving you one round of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In many applications you do not know if you want to use a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; datachannel but since you might, you preemptively create one and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; throw it 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; away. You can see that e.g. in Google Meet which calls
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    pc.createDataChannel(&#38;quot;ignored&#38;quot;, {reliable: true})
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It never uses that channel but it shows up in the getStats API 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; every time.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Does this mean that a data channel will be negotiated without 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; calling createDataChannel?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The underlying SCTP association will be negotiated and can be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; used by subsequent calls to createDataChannel without renegotiation.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This currently means exchanging four packets over the network 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (but that upfront cost might go away later this year).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Everything is set up to just work.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Will that requested datachannel result in a datachannel event 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; or does my code still need to call createDataChannel? If the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; latter, is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this a performance optimization? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Part of it is a performance / ergonomics optimization. But 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; behold, there comes the 2011 backward compat angle below.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would I choose this when data is more important to connect 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; first rather than e.g. voice / video?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Lets say you have a stream from getUserMedia with audio and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video and would also like to have a datachannel.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; You call pc.createDataChannel and then iterate over the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; MediaStream&#39;s getTracks and call pc.addTrack with each.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Because data channels were new and fancy in 2011 and backward 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compat was a concern this results in SDP (due to rules in RFC 8829) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; puts the datachannel bits in the SDP after the audio and video bits 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (and in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Safari the order of audio and video bits depend on the lexical 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ordering of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the random uuid of the MediaStreamTrack) so the SDP looks roughly 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; like this:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   v=0 (6 more lines)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=audio 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 63 111 (23 more lines) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; direction=sendonly mid=0
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=video 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96 97 98 99 100 101 45 46 (63 more 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lines) direction=sendonly mid=1
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   m=application 9 UDP/DTLS/SCTP webrtc-datachannel (9 more 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lines) direction=sendrecv mid=2
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Which is ok but you are probably scratching your head why this 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; order does not match the order of calls (or why in Safari you get 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; video-audio-application half the time)

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specifies this (search for &#38;quot;Lastly, &#38;quot;) but does not provide much of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rationale. &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/735&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; has some 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 2016 rationale.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now that seems like an odd choice but had little consequence 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; until...

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; WebRTC added APIs that allow you to negotiate codecs at some 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; point. This can result in a situation where you end up with a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; incompatible 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; set of video codecs (see the bug) and if those happen to be first 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; SDP this &#38;quot;m=&#38;quot; line will be marked as &#38;quot;rejected&#38;quot; and can not be used 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; convey the transport information anymore.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; At best this results in another round of negotiation to satisfy
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#name-rejecting-a-media-descripti&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Now 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#34;&#38;gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8843#section-7.2.1&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; actually provides a recommendation on how to avoid this: you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; pick something that is &#38;quot;unlikely to be rejected by the remote side&#38;quot;.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The browser does not have an API that would lead to it rejecting 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a datachannel m= line (which can happen for audio and video)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; So it would be great to pick this datachannel m= line as 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;quot;offerer tagged&#38;quot; which avoids this headache.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; But that requires (unless you want to risk more breakage) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; putting this m= line first which is conflicts with the rules of RFC 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 8829.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The alternative is going through at least two rounds of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; negotiation (which involves the remote end), the first datachannel 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; only and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; then adding media.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hence you need a way to opt-in which is the boolean in the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; RTCConfiguration.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It sounds like you&#39;re saying here that this may not be backwards 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compatible and if the other end doesn&#39;t support it you may not be able 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; establish a connection. If so, is it possible for the developer to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; detect whether the browser supports this so that they may determine 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; whether 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; both ends support this or not before setting it?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Would you like to hear more about why WebRTC is so weird? (a lot of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this boils down to &#38;quot;SDP is not an opaque blob)

&#38;gt; &#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; A bit more details would be useful here.
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; Even reading through 
&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api?tab=readme-ov-file#precommit-handlers&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api?tab=readme-ov-file#precommit-handlers&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;, 
&#38;gt; the role of post-commit handlers, nor how does one define them today is not 
&#38;gt; clear.
&#38;gt; &#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; I *think* I have a vague idea, so let me try to take a stab and let me 
&#38;gt; know if I got it right.
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; Currently a developer that wants to add a post-commit handler (or simply 
&#38;gt; a `handler` in the current API) to e.g. send analytics that a navigation 
&#38;gt; has happened, can do that using
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ```
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; {
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; if (e.canIntercept) {
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; const handler = sendAnalytics(e);
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; e.intercept({ handler });
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; }
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; });
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ```
&#38;gt; &#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; When they want to do something pre-commit (e.g. cancel the navigation if 
&#38;gt; the target URL doesn&#39;t lead to a cat video), they can do something like
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ```
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; {
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; if (e.canIntercept) {
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; const precommitHandler = verifyCatVideo(controller);
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; e.intercept({ precommitHandler });
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; }
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; });
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; ```
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; They can even add both.
&#38;gt; &#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; But when developers today want to add a post-commit (or &#38;quot;regular&#38;quot;) 
&#38;gt; handler as a result of some handler in the pre-commit, they have no way of 
&#38;gt; doing that.
&#38;gt; &#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; This proposal is to add an `addHandler` method to the precommit 
&#38;gt; controller, that would enable to add such post-commit handlers.
&#38;gt; &#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; Is that roughly accurate?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Yes!
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; &#38;gt; If so, what would be an example use-case of wanting to add a post-commit 
&#38;gt; handler as a result of pre-commit logic? What information does the 
&#38;gt; pre-commit handler have that a post-commit logic doesn&#39;t?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Something like this, where the precommit handler performs some logic
&#38;gt; to understand what to do with the request, and perhaps begins some
&#38;gt; sort of shell, to be later populated by the handler:
&#38;gt; ```js
&#38;gt; navigation.addEventListener(&#38;quot;navigate&#38;quot;, e =&#38;gt; {
&#38;gt; if (e.canIntercept) {
&#38;gt; e.intercept({
&#38;gt; async precommitHandler(controller) {
&#38;gt; if (should_redirect(e.destination.url)) [
&#38;gt; e.redirect(new_url);
&#38;gt; return;
&#38;gt; }
&#38;gt; else if (should_cancel(destination.url)) {
&#38;gt; throw new Error(&#38;quot;cancel this navigation&#38;quot;);
&#38;gt; }
&#38;gt; const contentPromise = fetchPageData();
&#38;gt; const shell = await fetchPageShell();
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; shell.show_skeleton();
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; controller.addHandler(() =&#38;gt; show_actual_data(await contentPromise));
&#38;gt; }
&#38;gt; }
&#38;gt; });
&#38;gt; ```
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Doing it this way is slightly more ergonomic than managing promises
&#38;gt; outside of the intercept call.

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;So the element bearing the class has to be specifically within the shadow
tree to work, despite the element bearing the class being an ancestor of
both of them? Oh, dear... Not very intuitive.
Thank you for the quick response.&#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

&#38;gt; The &#38;quot;apply&#38;quot; class is not in the &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; shadow tree because it&#39;s not part of

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This has some risk of being a breaking change, right? How would
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you characterize that risk? Firefox having this is obviously a good sign,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; but any other data or arguments on the risk? I imagine SVG use is fairly
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rare, and any selector mismatch would most likely be a minor formatting
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issue, right?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; That, or some display:none rule that didn&#39;t work before, starts working
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; now, which could be a major or minor issue.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; An instantiated subtree will no longer be able to do selector matching
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; against the surrounding elements from where it was instantiated from.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In the following case, the use instance of the rect would no longer be
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; red:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;!DOCTYPE html&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;style&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   .original rect { fill: red; }
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   rect { fill: green; }
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;/style&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;svg&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;defs class=&#38;quot;original&#38;quot;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;     &#38;lt;rect id=&#38;quot;r&#38;quot; x=&#38;quot;0&#38;quot; y=&#38;quot;0&#38;quot; width=&#38;quot;100&#38;quot; height=&#38;quot;100&#38;quot; /&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;/defs&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;   &#38;lt;use href=&#38;quot;#r&#38;quot;&#38;gt;&#38;lt;/use&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;/svg&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I think this is unlikely to break real sites.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I spent some time poking through the Firefox bug and its various
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; associated bugs. I think it&#39;s a pretty good sign that this landed 8 years
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ago and the reported regressions were due to implementation bugs that were
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; quickly fixed.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The absence of bugs in Bugzilla isn&#39;t a perfect compat signal, but it&#39;s
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; at least promising.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In order to use-count this, we would have to run both ways of cascading
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (or at least selector matching) to detect such cases.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This sounds like a lot of complexity (but feel free to respond telling
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; me it&#39;s trivial to implement). So, LGTM2 and hopefully I&#39;m not wrong about
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the risk here.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The main benefit from this change, I think, is that it fixes
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://crbug.com/40663285&#34;&#38;gt;https://crbug.com/40663285&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt; which is about :hover and other state
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; selector matching which is currently broken in &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instances.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; matching CSS rules in &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; element trees.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Match selectors against the &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instantiation elements instead of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the originating element subtree. This means selectors will no longer 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; match
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ancestor and sibling elements outside the cloned subtree. More 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; importantly,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; state selectors like :hover will now start matching in &#38;lt;use&#38;gt; instances.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; or interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; issues in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

After taking a closer look into the UMA, I realized that the use counter 
was not measuring active and intentional usage of these properties. 
Instead, it largely captures cases when an element’s resolved css values 
are retrieved (most commonly via `getComputedStyle()`, also via opening dev 
tools). &#38;lt;/pre&#38;gt;&#38;lt;pre&#38;gt;

Because the default width values are non-zero (medium) and their 
corresponding style’s default is none, the counter can fire even when 
authors never explicitly set these or retrieve these properties. This 
happens because `getComputedStyle()` requests/serializes styles for all 
properties on the element, not just the one an author may care about. As a 
result, the ~2.37% figure can be treated as a very high upper bound on 
potential exposure rather than a granular measurement of these specific 
properties. 

Unfortunately, with the current setup it is not trivial to architect a use 
counter that measures only when developers meaningfully use these 
properties as opposed to incidental serialization during style queries. To 
get some directional signal, I manually surveyed the top 10 sites that the 
counter fired for and did not find any that were doing anything special 
with these properties.

That said, each behavior change (for the computed and for the resolved) is 
guarded by its own finch feature flag, which provides a reliable rollout 
plan and kill switch if we observe unexpected impact on developers.

&#38;gt; I think the 2.37% use case is definitely interesting since if scrapers are 
&#38;gt; causing this, I would expect the number to either be much higher (scrapers 
&#38;gt; accessing this on most sites) or much lower (it&#39;s a negligible use case).  
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; That being said, I&#39;m also not convinced that these are &#38;quot;real developers&#38;quot; 
&#38;gt; doing this on more than 2% of sites. 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Is it possible to check httparchive for a random sampling of websites that 
&#38;gt; trigger this UMA and see if there is a pattern that emerges or whether 
&#38;gt; there is script that accesses these properties?
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; In either case, in light of both Firefox and Safari shipping and the fact 
&#38;gt; that outlines don&#39;t affect box geometry, I&#39;m inclined to approve with a 
&#38;gt; note to be cautious in launching this and follow a finch rollout that 
&#38;gt; propagates the feature to the stable channel slowly.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; With that, LGTM1.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Also, it would be nice to follow up about the 2.37% to see if there is a 
&#38;gt; solid explanation

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hi,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thanks for the questions. Find below my responses:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - Question: As a non-CSS expert, can you help me better understand 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    what &#38;quot;applying that special-case becomes ambiguous and difficult to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; define 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    consistently&#38;quot;? Is this in terms of code that authors would write, or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; prose 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    for spec authors? An example would be helpful here. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - Answer: The ambiguity is primarily around spec semantics. Gap 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       decorations extended the column-rule-* properties to accept value 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lists and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       `repeat()` patterns. The previous rule (“if style is none/hidden, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; then 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       computed width is 0”) is straightforward for a single value, but with 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lists 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       and repeats you no longer have a clean, well-defined way of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; expressing this 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       behavior. For example, from the CSSWG discussion: 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-style: solid dashed none; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-width: 1px 2px;  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - This cycles to: “1px solid, 2px dashed, (1px) none, 2px solid, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       1px dashed, (2px) none …”.  
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - Setting the width to zero in this case depending on the style 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       at any point in the expansion isn’t well-defined. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - Also, `repeat()` syntax is preserved at computed-value time, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       which further prevents expanding lists and applying a clean 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; index-based 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       rule: 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-style: repeat(2, solid none dashed); 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-width: 1px 2px; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - This would expand to: “1px (solid), 2px (none), 1px(dashed), 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       2px(solid), 1px(none), 2px (dashed) …” But computed values explicitly 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; do 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       not perform this expansion, so any rule that depends on per-index 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; alignment 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       between style and width cannot be spec&#39;d in a well-defined way. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - Question: 2.37% of page views is a lot of page views. Why do we 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    feel confident that border-width needs backwards compat considerations 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    getComputedStyle but column-rule-width and outline-width don&#39;t? Are you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    saying that 2.37% of the use counters are coming from fingerprinting? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;m 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    also not sure what it means for a scraper to trigger a UseCounter - can 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    clarify? I&#39;ve typically thought of scraping as a server-side operation - 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    are these web extensions?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - Why do we feel confident that border-width needs backwards compat 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       considerations for getComputedStyle and column-rule-width and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; outline-width 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       don’t? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - `border-*-width` properties are more commonly used and are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          tied to the box model, so changing what getComputedStyle() returns 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is more 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          likely to affect existing scripts that compute geometry or layout 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; related 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          behavior. In contrast, outline-width and column-rule-width are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; less 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          commonly used and are only used for visual decoration so returning 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          author-specified width rather than 0px should not affect the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; element’s 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          geometry, making user-visible regressions less likely. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - On the 2.37% 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - The use counter added was scoped to trigger when the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          resolved value gotten from getComputedStyle is called on an 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; element where 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          style is none/hidden but width is non-zero. While 2.37% is high we 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; believe 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          the traffic is dominated by: 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             - Fingerprinting/Telemetry scripts that typically iterate 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             over every CSS property to build a unique “fingerprint” of the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; browser. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             - Generic serializers that read all styles to copy/paste or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             inspect elements 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - The default for these properties is *-width: medium and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          *-style: none. This is also a contributing factor to this high 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; percentage. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          So even if a site doesn’t explicitly set these values and is being 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; scraped, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          by virtue of the defaults, the counter will get hit. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - On scrapers being server side 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             - In recent times, we’ve seen scrapers be headless browser 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             automation like Puppeteer or Selenium or client-side scripts in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; real 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             browsers. They can execute Javascript and call getComputedStyle 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; which in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             this case would expect the counter to be hit.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             These tools often query hundreds of properties which 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             signals that a high query rate does not necessarily imply 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; meaningful 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             web-facing dependence on the current behavior. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - Also, we are not first movers in this case, Webkit and Gecko 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          have shipped this.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This proposal untangles ‘border-width’, ‘outline-width’, and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘column-rule-width’ from their corresponding ‘*-style’ properties. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Previously, if a ‘*-style’ property, such as ‘border-style’, was set to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘none’ or ‘hidden’, the computed ‘*-width’, such as ‘border-width’, would 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolve to ‘0px’, even if the width was explicitly set to ‘10px’. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Following 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a resolution in the CSSWG [1], the computed values of ‘border-width’, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘outline-width’, and ‘column-rule-width’ will now reflect their specified 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; values, regardless of the associated style property&#39;s value. Similarly, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolved values of ‘outline-width’, and ‘column-rule-width’ will now

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Today, CSS special-cases ‘border-*-width’, ‘outline-width’, and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘column-rule-width’ so that their computed value becomes ‘0px’ when the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; corresponding ‘*-style’ is ‘none’ or ‘hidden’, even if the author 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specified 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a nonzero width. With Gap Decorations extending ‘column-rule-*’ properties 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to support lists/repeaters, applying that special-case becomes ambiguous 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and difficult to define consistently. Having ‘*-width’ values independent 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of ‘*-style’, provides an intuitive model for these properties and better 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; reflects the author-specified value. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; As a non-CSS expert, can you help me better understand what &#38;quot;applying 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that special-case becomes ambiguous and difficult to define consistently&#38;quot;? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Is this in terms of code that authors would write, or prose for spec 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authors? An example would be helpful here.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Risks*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The interoperability risk is low as both Gecko and Webkit have already 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implemented these changes. Compatibility risk is also low. The resolved 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; value for `border-width` via `getComputedStyle()` will remain 0px when 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; `border-style` is set to `none`/ `hidden`, maintaining backward 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compatibility. For `outline-width` and `column-rule-width`, both computed 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and resolved values will show the specified values, as these properties 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rarely queried and unlikely to impact existing content. To support the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; claim, we collected UseCounter data measuring how often these values are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; queried. The computed‑value counters for these properties are extremely 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; low 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (&#38;lt;0.0001%). The resolved‑value counters for ‘column-rule-width’ and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘outline-width’ show ~2.37% usage, which reflects calls to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘getComputedStyle()’ rather than observable rendering usage. Since 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘getComputedStyle()’ is frequently queried by automated tooling (e.g. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; scrapers and fingerprinting scripts) that do not depend on property 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; semantics, this usage does not indicate meaningful web‑facing reliance. As 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a result, the compatibility risk remains low. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 2.37% of page views is a lot of page views. Why do we feel confident 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that border-width needs backwards compat considerations for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; getComputedStyle but column-rule-width and outline-width don&#39;t? Are you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; saying that 2.37% of the use counters are coming from fingerprinting? I&#39;m 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; also not sure what it means for a scraper to trigger a UseCounter - can 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; clarify? I&#39;ve typically thought of scraping as a server-side operation - 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; are these web extensions?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; thanks!

Summary
Reports accurate inputType values for deletion keyboard shortcuts on selected 
text. When deletion commands like Ctrl+Backspace or Ctrl+Delete are used with 
selected text in contenteditable elements, the beforeinput and input events now 
report deleteContentBackward or deleteContentForward instead of 
deleteWordBackward or deleteWordForward. This enables web developers to 
correctly understand what editing operation occurred and implement reliable 
undo/redo or custom editing behaviors.

Specification

&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/text.html#TextPathElement&#34;&#38;gt;https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/text.html#TextPathElement&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;



Summary

This change adds support for the path attribute on the SVG &#38;lt;textPath&#38;gt; element, 
allowing authors to define text path geometry inline using SVG path data and 
reducing the need for separately defined &#38;lt;path&#38;gt; elements.



&#38;lt;textPath&#38;gt; resolves its text path geometry using the following rules:



1. If both path and href are present, geometry is resolved from the path 
attribute.

2. If only the path attribute is present and parses successfully, the inline 
path definition is used.

3. If the path attribute is absent or fails to parse, and an href attribute is 
provided, the referenced &#38;lt;path&#38;gt; element is used as a fallback.

4. Existing href‑only behavior is preserved without change.



This implementation follows the SVG 2 specification’s definition of the path 
attribute on &#38;lt;textPath&#38;gt;, and the resolution behavior is consistent with other 
browser engines, improving interoperability and standards compliance.



Note: When both path and href are specified on &#38;lt;textPath&#38;gt;, path now takes 
precedence, per SVG 2 specification.

Motivation

Before this change, Chromium required &#38;lt;textPath&#38;gt; to reference a separate &#38;lt;path&#38;gt; 
element via href in order to define text path geometry. While functional, this 
limitation diverged from the SVG 2 specification and from behavior in other 
browser engines that support inline path data via the path attribute. As a 
result, SVG content authored for cross‑browser compatibility frequently 
rendered incorrectly in Chromium or required duplicating path definitions 
solely to accommodate Chromium’s lack of support.



Supporting the path attribute allows authors to define self‑contained 
text‑on‑path geometry directly on &#38;lt;textPath&#38;gt;, reducing DOM indirection and 
improving authoring ergonomics without changing existing href‑based behavior. 
This aligns Chromium’s behavior with the SVG specification and other engines, 
eliminates a known source of interoperability issues, and reduces the need for 
browser‑specific workarounds in real‑world SVG content.



Initial public proposal

No information provided



TAG review

Not requested. This change implements an existing SVG 2 feature and does not 
introduce new web‑exposed APIs or primitives.



TAG review status

Not applicable



Risks



Interoperability and Compatibility

Behavior change risk:

Previously, Chromium ignored the path attribute on &#38;lt;textPath&#38;gt; and always 
resolved text geometry via href. With this change, when both path and href are 
specified, the path attribute takes precedence, per the SVG 2 specification. As 
a result, some existing SVG content that relied on href may render differently 
post‑ship. This aligns Chromium with other browser engines and improves 
standards compliance.



Mitigation: The feature is guarded by a Finch flag 
(SvgTextPathPathAttributeEnabled), which can be used as a kill‑switch if 
unexpected compatibility issues arise.

Web developers: Positive

One user has noted they are impacted by the CrBug.



Other signals:



Security

This feature does not introduce new script‑accessible APIs, cross‑origin 
capabilities, or user‑exposed surface area. It enables use of inline SVG path 
data in a context that already accepts path geometry via referenced &#38;lt;path&#38;gt; 
elements. The same SVG path parsing and rendering logic already exercised by 
&#38;lt;path&#38;gt; elements is reused for the path attribute on &#38;lt;textPath&#38;gt;. No additional 
memory exposure, network access, or privilege changes are introduced.



WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that it 
has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

No.

This change does not deprecate or modify existing APIs. It adds support for a 
previously unsupported SVG attribute and preserves existing href‑only behavior.



Debuggability

Issues related to this feature are debuggable using existing SVG and DOM 
inspection tools. The resolved path used by &#38;lt;textPath&#38;gt; can be inspected via the 
DOM and verified through rendered output. Invalid inline path values gracefully 
fall back to href, avoiding hard failures and making rendering issues visible 
rather than silent. No new debugging tooling is required.



Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, 
ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?

Yes

Anticipated spec changes

Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or interop 
issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues in the 
project for the feature specification) whose resolution may introduce web 
compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of the API in a 
non-backward-compatible way).

There is an open discussion in the SVG Working Group regarding validation 
requirements for the path attribute on &#38;lt;textPath&#38;gt;, specifically whether the 
entire path data must be valid in order for the attribute to be used:  
&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/w3c/svgwg/issues/393&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/w3c/svgwg/issues/393&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;



The current implementation follows the SVG 2 specification as written and 
aligns with existing behavior in other engines. If the resolution of this issue 
results in clarified or changed requirements around partial path validity, 
minor behavior adjustments may be required in the future. At present, no 
concrete spec changes have been adopted.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hello,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; It occurred to me that document-local terminology likely would have to be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; conveyed to the browser in two different places with this proposal and Web 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Speech&#39;s Contextual Biasing - 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; &#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/WebAudio/web-speech-api/blob/main/explainers/contextual-biasing.md&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/WebAudio/web-speech-api/blob/main/explainers/contextual-biasing.md&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The end result is different (this proposal being for suppression, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Contextual Biasing for boosting) but I would imagine the input likely 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; heavily overlaps (e.g. given your Pokemon usecase) - it seems like an 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; architectural consideration for interop between these two mechanisms would 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; be beneficial for developer ergonomics.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hi Rick, Daniel,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;m looking at the case of a non-persistent and document-local 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; dictionary that stores the word list in memory. Is it Okay to illustrate a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; bit more on why Blink&#38;gt;DOM might not be the right component for this? And 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; what are the issues you could foresee on ensuring the data is reliably 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; per-document?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thank you!

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Regarding motivation, our client has financial data, such as 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; stock symbols and company names. There are similar use cases for medical 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; data, fan fiction, or anything else with words that might not appear in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; hunspell&#39;s dictionaries. It&#39;s conceivable that the Google internal 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; spelling 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; APIs have these words but clients may be very reluctant to send their 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; strings to Google.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The proposal in this intent is relatively straightforward to implement 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and privacy and security is relatively simple to assess. But for 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; developers 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; there will probably be significant load time costs around it, to fetch 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; site&#39;s dictionary and process it to add the words.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;d love to see some figures on this. Maybe a bulk add API would be 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; enough? As a quick example I picked a random website (bloomberg.com) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and found it downloaded 3.4MB compressed including a number of individual 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; scripts, images and JSON blobs which were around 100kB compressed each. In 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; contrast the entire american-english dictionary on my linux machine 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compresses down to 270kB. So as long as we&#39;re talking about something 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that&#39;s less than 10% the size of the whole american english dictionary, my 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; hunch is that the transfer cost will be insignificant and lost in the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; noise. But still an http approach to at least enable caching would be a 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; good idea with little downside. I could imagine, for example, a &#38;lt;link 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rel=dictionary&#38;gt; tag or something that would be even simpler than this JS 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; API approach? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Anyway this is just random thoughts to try to nudge away from premature 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; optimization, not API owner input or anything :-).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We have some ideas around that in future work but nothing concrete. I 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; think we&#39;ll have to address it before we ship.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; A HTTP header approach would make the ergonomics easier (assuming the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; infrastructure for setting up a spelling server is reasonably standard) 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fits better into the existing code, But ti would not work offline. Maybe 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the approaches are complementary and we do both.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;ll try to get some idea on the size of typical dictionaries in this 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; space. It is important to know,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Spelling server seems a lot harder to get right to me, obviously more 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to worry about regarding privacy etc. Can you share anything more about 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; motivating use cases here? Like how large do these custom dictionaries 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; tend 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to be? I&#39;d guess that for even dictionaries up to 1MB compressed it&#39;s 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; probably faster and simpler to just have the client download the whole 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; thing. RTT latency is generally a bigger performance problem these days 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; than raw throughput. But if it&#39;s important to solve scenarios with 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; really 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; large dictionaries then maybe it&#39;s worth exploring?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; We&#39;re also considering an entirely different approach whereby a site 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; provides a &#38;quot;spelling server&#38;quot; URL in the HTML header. That would operate 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; more like the existing &#38;quot;send it to Google&#38;quot; spell checking options.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; super early in designing such a thing, but if anyone has early feedback

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that approach we would be interested.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; think I understand the overall design and I think it&#39;s a good one: 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; these 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; dictionaries are transient and document-local, simply a mechanism to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; let 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; pages selectively suppress spell check violations on their own page.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Presumably discussion of network fetches in the explainer are just 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; about the app fetching from it&#39;s server (not fetches in the browser), 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; all the discussions of &#38;quot;persistent&#38;quot; storage are under the &#38;quot;future 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; work&#38;quot; 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; section so it&#39;s fine to me that there&#39;s no detail here (it&#39;s out of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; scope 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; because it&#39;s hard). I&#39;m not sure whether it would make sense to extend 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; this 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; design into persistent storage or not, but I&#39;m also not sure it 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; matters (as 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the explainer says it&#39;s simply an optimization - a problem that may or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; may 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; not exist in practice so not worth worrying about today). 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Ensuring the data is reliably per-document is definitely a key 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; implementation concern, so I agree with you there Daniel. And yes 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; we&#39;ll 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; eventually want signals from other browser vendors, but our process

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; only after prototyping is complete (often we learn a lot about the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; design 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; from prototyping), so it&#39;s premature to ask for it now at I2P phase.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hello,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This intent came up in security review, and I&#39;m mostly confused:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - The explainer mostly seems to assume that these are stored 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; in-memory, per-document. But it also talks about absence of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cross-origin-requests; only to add info about CORS, which only makes 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; sense 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for cross-origin requests.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - There are multiple references to loading data, but there is no 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; explanation about what kind of network requests are being made when 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; where.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - The explainer suggests &#38;quot;Persistently store data&#38;quot; as an 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; optimization for having to re-load large dictionaries. Again, no 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; information about which requests are being optimized away.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - In &#38;quot;Data Storage&#38;quot; it is pointed out that CustomDictionaryEngine 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; exists per renderer process. While renderer processes mostly don&#39;t 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; have 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; cross-origin data, they sometimes do. And they may hold multiple 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; documents. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This seems inconsistent with information being stored per-document.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Non-security feedback:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Since this is a web-exposed API, I&#39;d have expected some attempt 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; at checking with other browser engines on support.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - I do not understand the &#38;quot;High-level Architecture&#38;quot;. It seems to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feature a stack of methods that feeds into yes/no decisions which 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; feeds 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; into a storage thing. I have no idea what this is meant to convey.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; - Blink&#38;gt;DOM might not be the right component for this.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Could you please update the documentation to be more clear about 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; where data is stored, and about which network requests are being made?

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The proposed APIs enable users to modify the document local 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; dictionary in the browser. Users can add, remove, and check words in 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; document local dictionary. This feature ensures the browser does not 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; mark 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; words in the document local dictionary as spelling errors.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Motivation 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Some words need to be added to the document custom dictionary so 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that the browser does not mark them as spelling errors. The added 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; words 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; need to be removed at some point if they aren&#39;t necessary. Current 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specs 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; such as element.spellcheck attribute and ::spelling-error CSS 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; pseudo-element manage the words already in the dictionary. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Therefore, the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; new API would be needed to manipulate the document local dictionary.

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt; WebXR Layers offers a more efficient way of drawing immersive content. In 
&#38;gt; addition to support for native color and depth textures and texture arrays, 
&#38;gt; it also provides support for different layer types that are managed by the 
&#38;gt; system compositor (as opposed to javascript).

&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt; Performance: Layers are presented at the frame rate of the compositor but 
&#38;gt; can be updated at a lower rate in the browser. The compositor can reproject 
&#38;gt; layers at high refresh while the browser just needs to draw pixels when 
&#38;gt; they need to change (instead of when the user moves) Legibility / visual 
&#38;gt; fidelity: In a typical WebXR session, the pixels are resampled twice. This 
&#38;gt; greatly affects text legibility by drawing into a layers, resampling only 
&#38;gt; happens once. Power consumption / battery life: Because the browser only 
&#38;gt; has to render the pixels that changed and can rely on the compositor to 
&#38;gt; draw cubemaps and equirects, far less javascript and gl commands need to 
&#38;gt; run in the browser which increases the system&#39;s battery life. Latency: 
&#38;gt; Since the compositor always has the latest pose data and runs at very high 
&#38;gt; system priority, the scene will “stick” to the right location which 
&#38;gt; improves the experience and lowers user fatigue. A good example where this 
&#38;gt; all comes to gether is 360 videos. With regular WebXR, a large framework 
&#38;gt; and very careful coding is needed to do the reprojection. Typically, the 
&#38;gt; resolution and framerates of the video is lowered so the experience can fit 
&#38;gt; in the cpu/memory budget of the device. The efficiency gains of layers

&#38;gt; *Risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt; The spec is based upon the feature set of OpenXR with wide 
&#38;gt; consensus/support across devices &#38;amp; operating systems. As long as the 
&#38;gt; platform supports this standard (or something close to it), it should be 
&#38;gt; possible to implement. 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Gecko*: Defer (&#38;lt;a  rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/412&#34;&#38;gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/412&#38;lt;/a&#38;gt;)
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *WebKit*: Support (

&#38;gt; member has no objections to the spec moving from the CG to the WG
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Web developers*: Positive Positive initial response (privately) from 
&#38;gt; multiple popular XR video framework developers.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Other signals*:
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Ergonomics*
&#38;gt; The WebXR layers API is extending the WebXR feature set. Its primary use 
&#38;gt; case is improved performance and rendering quality. Today, authors have to 
&#38;gt; rely on large frameworks to render high quality 360 or 180 video and they 
&#38;gt; have to be very careful to not overload the system. With layers, this is 
&#38;gt; now natively supported by the browser and since the compositor will do a 
&#38;gt; lot of the heavy lifting, the load on the browser is significantly lower. 
&#38;gt; We expect this API to improve developer ergonomics in WebXR.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Activation*
&#38;gt; Not all user agents will have immediate support for this feature. To 
&#38;gt; mitigate this, we are planning on creating a polyfill.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Security*
&#38;gt; This spec leans heavily on WebXR existing security mitigations. The spec 
&#38;gt; calls out some additional rules.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *WebView application risks*
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that 
&#38;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications? 
&#38;gt; *No information provided* 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Debuggability*
&#38;gt; WebXR Layers are debugged in the same fashion as regular WebXR. 
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; *Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, 
&#38;gt; Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and Android WebView)?*
&#38;gt; No 
&#38;gt; The feature performs best if the platform has native support for layers 
&#38;gt; which can be done through OpenXR or some other native API. We expect that 
&#38;gt; most implementations will take that path. It might be possible to build a 
&#38;gt; compositor into Chrome itself as a fallback.

&#38;gt; &#38;gt; follow a finch rollout that propagates the feature to the stable channel
&#38;gt; slowly
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; For this type of change this risks more confusion/breakage to
&#38;gt; web-developers &#38;amp; users vs. just letting it roll out via the normal stable
&#38;gt; ramp and using the kill-switch if needed.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; Previously we&#39;ve had issues where we&#39;ve tried to roll out web-platform
&#38;gt; changes like this via finch, and it has caused more trouble than its worth.
&#38;gt; (E.g. Previously when we&#39;ve tried to roll things out incrementally, it led
&#38;gt; to web developers not reporting issues, as they thought it was some
&#38;gt; transient issue caused by an extension of similar. This leaks to a longer
&#38;gt; breakage for end-users vs. if the bug was reported immediately).
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt; non-owner lgtm FWIW, but just with a kill-switch type rollout.
&#38;gt;

I&#39;m talking about something on the order of a week at 1%, a week at 10% and
then moving to 100%, which is still pretty fast. I guess this feature
doesn&#39;t affect things like performance or metrics, so there&#39;s nothing to
compare to other than &#38;quot;there are no bug reports&#38;quot;. Kill-switch roll out also
sounds fine to me.

Thanks,
Vlad

&#38;gt;&#38;gt; After taking a closer look into the UMA, I realized that the use counter
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; was not measuring active and intentional usage of these properties.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Instead, it largely captures cases when an element’s resolved css values
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; are retrieved (most commonly via `getComputedStyle()`, also via opening
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; dev tools).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Because the default width values are non-zero (medium) and their
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; corresponding style’s default is none, the counter can fire even when
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authors never explicitly set these or retrieve these properties. This
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; happens because `getComputedStyle()` requests/serializes styles for all
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; properties on the element, not just the one an author may care about. As a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; result, the ~2.37% figure can be treated as a very high upper bound on
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; potential exposure rather than a granular measurement of these specific
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; properties.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Unfortunately, with the current setup it is not trivial to architect a
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; use counter that measures only when developers meaningfully use these
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; properties as opposed to incidental serialization during style queries. To
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; get some directional signal, I manually surveyed the top 10 sites that the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; counter fired for and did not find any that were doing anything special
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with these properties.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; That said, each behavior change (for the computed and for the resolved)
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; is guarded by its own finch feature flag, which provides a reliable rollout
&#38;gt;&#38;gt; plan and kill switch if we observe unexpected impact on developers.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I think the 2.37% use case is definitely interesting since if scrapers
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; are causing this, I would expect the number to either be much higher
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (scrapers accessing this on most sites) or much lower (it&#39;s a negligible
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; use case).
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; That being said, I&#39;m also not convinced that these are &#38;quot;real developers&#38;quot;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; doing this on more than 2% of sites.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Is it possible to check httparchive for a random sampling of websites
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that trigger this UMA and see if there is a pattern that emerges or whether
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; there is script that accesses these properties?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; In either case, in light of both Firefox and Safari shipping and the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; fact that outlines don&#39;t affect box geometry, I&#39;m inclined to approve with
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a note to be cautious in launching this and follow a finch rollout that
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; propagates the feature to the stable channel slowly.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Hi,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Thanks for the questions. Find below my responses:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - Question: As a non-CSS expert, can you help me better understand
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    what &#38;quot;applying that special-case becomes ambiguous and difficult to 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; define
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    consistently&#38;quot;? Is this in terms of code that authors would write, or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; prose
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    for spec authors? An example would be helpful here.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - Answer: The ambiguity is primarily around spec semantics. Gap
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       decorations extended the column-rule-* properties to accept value 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; lists and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       `repeat()` patterns. The previous rule (“if style is none/hidden, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; then
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       computed width is 0”) is straightforward for a single value, but 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; with lists
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       and repeats you no longer have a clean, well-defined way of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; expressing this
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       behavior. For example, from the CSSWG discussion:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-style: solid dashed none;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-width: 1px 2px;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - This cycles to: “1px solid, 2px dashed, (1px) none, 2px
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       solid, 1px dashed, (2px) none …”.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - Setting the width to zero in this case depending on the style
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       at any point in the expansion isn’t well-defined.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - Also, `repeat()` syntax is preserved at computed-value time,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       which further prevents expanding lists and applying a clean 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; index-based
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       rule:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-style: repeat(2, solid none dashed);
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - column-rule-width: 1px 2px;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - This would expand to: “1px (solid), 2px (none), 1px(dashed),
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       2px(solid), 1px(none), 2px (dashed) …” But computed values 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; explicitly do
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       not perform this expansion, so any rule that depends on per-index 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; alignment
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       between style and width cannot be spec&#39;d in a well-defined way.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - Question: 2.37% of page views is a lot of page views. Why do we
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    feel confident that border-width needs backwards compat considerations 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    getComputedStyle but column-rule-width and outline-width don&#39;t? Are you
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    saying that 2.37% of the use counters are coming from fingerprinting? 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; I&#39;m
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    also not sure what it means for a scraper to trigger a UseCounter - 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; can you
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    clarify? I&#39;ve typically thought of scraping as a server-side operation 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; -
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    are these web extensions?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;    - Why do we feel confident that border-width needs backwards
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       compat considerations for getComputedStyle and column-rule-width and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       outline-width don’t?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - `border-*-width` properties are more commonly used and are
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          tied to the box model, so changing what getComputedStyle() 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; returns is more
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          likely to affect existing scripts that compute geometry or 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; layout related
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          behavior. In contrast, outline-width and column-rule-width are 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; less
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          commonly used and are only used for visual decoration so 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; returning the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          author-specified width rather than 0px should not affect the 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; element’s
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          geometry, making user-visible regressions less likely.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;       - On the 2.37%
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - The use counter added was scoped to trigger when the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          resolved value gotten from getComputedStyle is called on an 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; element where
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          style is none/hidden but width is non-zero. While 2.37% is high 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; we believe
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          the traffic is dominated by:
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             - Fingerprinting/Telemetry scripts that typically iterate
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             over every CSS property to build a unique “fingerprint” of 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the browser.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             - Generic serializers that read all styles to copy/paste
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             or inspect elements
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - The default for these properties is *-width: medium and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          *-style: none. This is also a contributing factor to this high 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; percentage.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          So even if a site doesn’t explicitly set these values and is 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; being scraped,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          by virtue of the defaults, the counter will get hit.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - On scrapers being server side
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             - In recent times, we’ve seen scrapers be headless
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             browser automation like Puppeteer or Selenium or client-side 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; scripts in
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             real browsers. They can execute Javascript and call 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; getComputedStyle which
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             in this case would expect the counter to be hit.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             These tools often query hundreds of properties which
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             signals that a high query rate does not necessarily imply 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; meaningful
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;             web-facing dependence on the current behavior.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          - Also, we are not first movers in this case, Webkit and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;          Gecko have shipped this.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Summary*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; This proposal untangles ‘border-width’, ‘outline-width’, and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘column-rule-width’ from their corresponding ‘*-style’ properties.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Previously, if a ‘*-style’ property, such as ‘border-style’, was set to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘none’ or ‘hidden’, the computed ‘*-width’, such as ‘border-width’, would
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolve to ‘0px’, even if the width was explicitly set to ‘10px’. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Following
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a resolution in the CSSWG [1], the computed values of ‘border-width’,
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘outline-width’, and ‘column-rule-width’ will now reflect their specified
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; values, regardless of the associated style property&#39;s value. Similarly, 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolved values of ‘outline-width’, and ‘column-rule-width’ will now
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; reflect their specified values, regardless of the associated style
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; property&#39;s value. [1]:

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Motivation*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Today, CSS special-cases ‘border-*-width’, ‘outline-width’, and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘column-rule-width’ so that their computed value becomes ‘0px’ when the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; corresponding ‘*-style’ is ‘none’ or ‘hidden’, even if the author 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; specified
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a nonzero width. With Gap Decorations extending ‘column-rule-*’ 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; properties
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; to support lists/repeaters, applying that special-case becomes ambiguous
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and difficult to define consistently. Having ‘*-width’ values independent
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; of ‘*-style’, provides an intuitive model for these properties and better
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; reflects the author-specified value.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; As a non-CSS expert, can you help me better understand what &#38;quot;applying
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that special-case becomes ambiguous and difficult to define 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; consistently&#38;quot;?
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; Is this in terms of code that authors would write, or prose for spec
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; authors? An example would be helpful here.

&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; *Interoperability and Compatibility*
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; The interoperability risk is low as both Gecko and Webkit have
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; already implemented these changes. Compatibility risk is also low. The
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; resolved value for `border-width` via `getComputedStyle()` will remain 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 0px
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; when `border-style` is set to `none`/ `hidden`, maintaining backward
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; compatibility. For `outline-width` and `column-rule-width`, both computed
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; and resolved values will show the specified values, as these properties 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; are
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; rarely queried and unlikely to impact existing content. To support the
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; claim, we collected UseCounter data measuring how often these values are
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; queried. The computed‑value counters for these properties are extremely 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; low
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; (&#38;lt;0.0001%). The resolved‑value counters for ‘column-rule-width’ and
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘outline-width’ show ~2.37% usage, which reflects calls to
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘getComputedStyle()’ rather than observable rendering usage. Since
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; ‘getComputedStyle()’ is frequently queried by automated tooling (e.g.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; scrapers and fingerprinting scripts) that do not depend on property
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; semantics, this usage does not indicate meaningful web‑facing reliance. 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; As
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; a result, the compatibility risk remains low.
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; 2.37% of page views is a lot of page views. Why do we feel confident
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; that border-width needs backwards compat considerations for
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; getComputedStyle but column-rule-width and outline-width don&#39;t? Are you
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; saying that 2.37% of the use counters are coming from fingerprinting? I&#39;m
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; also not sure what it means for a scraper to trigger a UseCounter - can 
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; you
&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt;&#38;gt; clarify? I&#39;ve typically thought of scraping as a server-side operation -
