Summary

The Login Status API &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/fedidcg/login-status"&gt;https://github.com/fedidcg/login-status&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; (formerly
IdP Sign-in Status API) allows identity providers to signal to the browser
when their users are logging-in/out. Our goal is to open this up to other
websites in the future.

This signal, in this intent, is used by FedCM to address a silent timing
attack, and in doing so, allows FedCM to operate without third party
cookies altogether. This update would address the last remaining backwards
incompatible changes we had previously identified in the original I2S of
FedCM
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/URpYPPH-YQ4/m/E9pgS7GEBAAJ"&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/URpYPPH-YQ4/m/E9pgS7GEBAAJ&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
as part of our scope of work.

In the future, we expect that the Login Status API may also be used outside
of FedCM (e.g. the Storage Access API
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/fedidcg/login-status#storage-access-api"&gt;https://github.com/fedidcg/login-status#storage-access-api&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;) and may be
useful for websites that are not identity providers (e.g. extending browser
storage
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/fedidcg/login-status#extending-site-data-storage"&gt;https://github.com/fedidcg/login-status#extending-site-data-storage&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;).

RisksInteroperability and Compatibility

For interop:

This I2S is composed of two different (but interdependent) APIs: The Login
Status API and FedCM.

With regards to the Login Status API
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/fedidcg/login-status"&gt;https://github.com/fedidcg/login-status&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;, both Firefox and Safari are on
board with the general API (breakout notes
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/2023/09/13-login-status-minutes.html"&gt;https://www.w3.org/2023/09/13-login-status-minutes.html&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;, follow up notes
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/fedidcg/meetings/blob/main/2023/2023-09-14-TPAC-notes.md#login-status-api"&gt;https://github.com/fedidcg/meetings/blob/main/2023/2023-09-14-TPAC-notes.md#login-status-api&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;)
. There is an overall agreement on starting from a self-declared status and
also some general agreement on where the Login Status API may lead in the
future, including having higher assurance levels and applications outside
of FedCM.

With regards to its use in FedCM, Firefox is generally in agreement with
the shape of the solution. Firefox is working on the implementation behind
a flag. Safari isn’t shipping FedCM yet.

For compat:

While this is a backwards incompatible change for FedCM, we are in active
conversations with all IdPs that are currently using FedCM (as shown by our
UKM metrics) and they are onboard with this change.

Gecko: Under consideration (&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/pull/436"&gt;https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/pull/436&lt;/a&gt;) We
have been working with the Firefox team for the last year or so on this API
(e.g. TPAC 2022
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/blob/main/meetings/2022/FedCM_%20Options%20for%20the%20Timing%20Attack%20Problem%20"&gt;https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/blob/main/meetings/2022/FedCM_%20Options%20for%20the%20Timing%20Attack%20Problem%20&lt;/a&gt;(8_16_2022).pdf&amp;gt;).
We generally agree on the shape of the solution and we are working with
them to write the spec in a way that allows Chrome and Firefox to implement
FedCM in an interoperable way. (Firefox has asked us (
&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/431#issuecomment-1425025469"&gt;https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/431#issuecomment-1425025469&lt;/a&gt;) to
rely on PR comments instead of filing standards positions for these FedCM
extensions)

WebKit:  Under consideration (
&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/250"&gt;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/250&lt;/a&gt;)
No signal. Safari has so far shown overall support for FedCM [1], but
haven't yet formed a position on this specific extension of FedCM [2]. We
are generally in agreement of the API shape using the Login Status API [3],
but we haven't yet gotten signals from them on how FedCM, specifically, is
going to be using this signal.

[3] &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/privacycg/is-logged-in/issues/53"&gt;https://github.com/privacycg/is-logged-in/issues/53&lt;/a&gt;

Web developers: Positive (

We have been working with the FedID CG to develop this API and running
experiments with the Google Identity Services team.

Other signals:
Ergonomics

This is an API that is designed to be used by identity providers, when
their users login in to their websites. We exposed an HTTP header, since we
heard from them that logins are often made through 302 redirects. We are
also exposing a JS API for IdPs who find it easier to use JS than HTTP
headers. We show an error message in devtools when a FedCM request fails
because the user is not signed in.
WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

n/a, FedCM not supported on Webview
Debuggability

We show errors in devtools to help with debugging.


Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?

No
FedCM in general is not supported on WebView, but we support this API on
all other blink platforms.

Anticipated spec changes

Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

&lt;pre&gt;Hey all,

We've spent a LOT of time discussing this one in API OWNERS, and my 
disinclination to allow this to move forward remains. What we're observing 
in this Intent is an anti-pattern in which:&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

   - Chromium engineers follow a process that is designed to put developer 
   needs above implementer preferences 
   
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/2019/09/17-components-minutes.html#:~:text=chrishtr:%20I%20think%20having%20custom%20states%20was%20the%20%231%20request%20on%20top%20of%20parts"&gt;https://www.w3.org/2019/09/17-components-minutes.html#:~:text=chrishtr:%20I%20think%20having%20custom%20states%20was%20the%20%231%20request%20on%20top%20of%20parts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;,
 
   explore the design space earnestly, work with developers to vet a solution, 
   and work to build interest with other vendors 
   
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/CApU9QIu3TM/m/LPKLLLahDQAJ"&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/CApU9QIu3TM/m/LPKLLLahDQAJ&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
   .
   - Other projects fail to implement and/or implement alternatives.
   - The API OWNERS take a calculated risk to ship first. That is premised 
   on collateral the development team provides that the design solves an 
   important problem well, demonstrating developer support and that our 
   process for open development has given ample time for others to engage and 
   help shape the design.
   - Time passes (often years).
   - Without implementing themselves, other vendors demand that the design 
   change to achieve &amp;quot;consensus&amp;quot; within a standards body, but without 
   demonstrating real deficiencies in the shipped API or even feedback from 
   developers that we were wrong in some important way.


Or put another way, spec fiction is being allowed to trump real-world 
problem solving, and that's not what our process is designed to facilitate. 

Not only does this pattern further escalate the costs involved in the 
process to deliver a feature where we have already paid treble to 
ice-break, it potentially breaks applications -- remember that we suffer 
from enterprise blindness in our use counters, so it's probable that we 
will also need to reach out to, e.g., Salesforce and ask them to help 
collect data. This pattern also drags us away from other work that would 
expand the platform for users and developers in productive ways.

These costs may seems small on an individual feature basis, but they add up 
fast and set terrible precedent. I'm *extremely* unhappy that we seem to be 
engaging in more of it over the past year, particularly without strong 
arguments for why the new design is superior. Even the recent debate over 
this feature is largely about non-committal mild preferences:

&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4805#issuecomment-1663111980"&gt;https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4805#issuecomment-1663111980&lt;/a&gt;

At this point I've read substantially all of the minutes related to these 
design choices, and this is *absolutely *late bikeshedding by folks who 
haven't implemented either alternative and were widely consulted at the 
time we backstopped the initial I2S.

Per our conversation yesterday, I'm struggling to get to &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; on this. At 
a minimum, I need a stronger argument for why we should make this change 
than that someone in the CSS WG had a mild preference years after the CSS 
WG was first consulted on the problem. It would help if we had a commitment 
from the Intent proposers to avoid this sort of change in future. Deciding 
to ship this would also need to be clearly disclaimed as non-precedent, and 
I'd be looking from support of the managers of these teams to prevent this 
sort of make-work in future. How close are we to agreement on that?

Best,

Alex

&amp;gt; I don't normally weigh in on these but I just wanted to say that I think 
&amp;gt; this one is pretty unique for a whole bunch of reasons and it's not just an 
&amp;gt; example of bikeshedding after shipping by a specific vendor or something.  
&amp;gt; It's more than that.  As much as I think this is important, and wanted it, 
&amp;gt; there were a million other things to talk about re: custom elements that 
&amp;gt; were ahead of it and it just didn't get the level of oxygen that it needed 
&amp;gt; from many quarters, it seems to me, in order to surface the right 
&amp;gt; thoughts.  As it's picked up, over the last few years there were 
&amp;gt; disagreements, counterpoints, etc at many stages through WHATWG, TAG, 
&amp;gt; CSSWG... It feels like it would be good to summarize all of it somewhere - 
&amp;gt; and I'm not even saying the decision here is &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; or something ... I'm 
&amp;gt; just saying that I don't think it is as simple as &amp;quot;bikeshedding after 
&amp;gt; shipping&amp;quot; implies

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (see 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; comment from the chair) one motivation is to align with WHATWG and not end 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; up with a situation where two standards groups have opposing positions in a 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; gray-area situation and no progress is made.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't think that 0.03% is a big problem to deprecate, and recommend we 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; just make the change to match a hard-won consensus and move on. It's easy 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; enough to support both syntaxes for some amount of time before removing the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; old one.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and the suggestion was that if a CSS spec for a feature is &amp;quot;unstable&amp;quot; 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (meaning 'not at CR'?), then we should either post &amp;quot;we're about to send an 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; intent&amp;quot; to the last issue discussing it, or file an &amp;quot;Is X ready to ship?&amp;quot; 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; issue. I think +Chris Harrelson is likely to have the strongest 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; opinions about this: should we add such a rule to our launch process for 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CSS features?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think we generally shouldn't ship CSS features before there is robust 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; discussion and consensus at the CSSWG, and I think Chromium features have 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; done a good job at that. The CSSWG resolution mechanism, and the various 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; stages of W3C standardization help to build confidence about the degree of 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; consensus and commitment, as do signals from other browser vendors. I don't 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; think we should additionally require filing an &amp;quot;is X ready to ship?&amp;quot; issue 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; at the CSSWG for CSS features.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; I'd like to understand better how we wound up shipping :--foo and 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; then having the CSSWG ask us to change it to :state(foo) instead, and 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; what

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think if this was specced before shipping that would have been 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; better and is a practice that I (and we?) currently follow, but this was 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; shipped a number of years ago.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, good point: it's totally possible that our more recent process 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rigor is sufficient, and we don't need anything new to prevent this in 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; future. No matter what, we should expect the occasional old feature to 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; pop 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; up and be an exception.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do think that it's worth finding a way to write down your current 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; practice, so that it doesn't regress if you switch teams. I think you 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; mean 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that you do &amp;quot;hold off on shipping CSS features until they land in an 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; official draft&amp;quot;, so let's try to record that if it's our idea of the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; solution.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; As far as I can see, nobody asked for the ergonomic evidence that

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; says we can expect after Chrome has shipped a feature.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This was my bad, I didn't realize or didn't completely consider 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; usecounters before I presented the name change to the CSSWG.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I am hoping that with an answer from the API owners, I can go back to 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the CSSWG and potentially change it back.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There is still no merged spec in HTML or CSS for this feature yet, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but I have open PRs in both specs.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks!

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It looks like the initial proposal was :state(foo); the CSSWG asked 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to change it to :--foo in 2020

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; we shipped that in M90 in 2021

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; entry that still says :state 🙃); then Ryosuke suggested undoing 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that change in January 2023

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and the CSSWG accepted that suggestion in August

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this feature was so contentious that the team needed to use a name

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; as a bargaining chip, so we should probably have insisted on more

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; about this isn't as committed as it appears to an external observer?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Should we generally hold off on shipping CSS features until they 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; land in an official draft, or even in a CR? Should we be clearer to the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CSSWG when we decide to ship ahead of their consensus that the bar for 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; changes is going up? There's not good support for this kind of per-WG 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; restriction in Chrome Status yet, but maybe it'll fit near

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; milestones yet, but I'd like to get the API owners thoughts on 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; whether this 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deprecation would be acceptable to help guide the spec discussion.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I did some analysis of the top 8 websites on the chromestatus 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; entry to see what the breakage would be like: 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BHoO12ts0E-NQQH9AMwR2sKAIV0OPB-FA_8QXMpolz0/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BHoO12ts0E-NQQH9AMwR2sKAIV0OPB-FA_8QXMpolz0/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I found that most of them had the affected custom elements behind 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; display:none rules that I had to manually remove in order to use 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; them. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There was only one website where there was actual breakage by 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; default, in 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; which case the carousel buttons didn't work on firefox and safari. If 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; new syntax is just for the CSS property and we keep CustomStateSet 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; same, then the affected website's buttons would continue to work but 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; whatever custom styles they have (which I couldn't trigger) wouldn't 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; apply 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; anymore.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Personally, I think that this breakage would not be bad especially 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; if we keep CustomStateSet the same, and I kind of like :state(foo) 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; more 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; than :--foo. However, I might have not made it clear in the spec 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; discussions yet that we have already shipped :--foo by default for 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; several 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; years.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; recently made an effort to spec this feature in CSSWG and WHATWG, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but there 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; was pushback to change the syntax back from :--foo to :state(foo), 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CSSWG has resolved to do this as well: 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4805"&gt;https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4805&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The UseCounter is currently at 0.03%

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This deprecation will have a window where we support both the old 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; syntax and the new syntax so websites can switch to the new one.

Summary

This feature allows View transition API use to be customized for different
types of transitions. Specifically, this adds an ability to add &amp;quot;types&amp;quot; to
`startViewTransition` call which will identify the types of the transition.
As well, it will match a pseudo-class, called
`:active-view-transitions(...)` with a parameter matching the type for the
duration of the view transition. Combined these two features provide a way
for the author to declare several view transitions once and only trigger
one at a time. See example usage in the spec:

&lt;tt&gt;Jason, could you please work with Lu to figure out why he can't post 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;comments in the chromestatus entry (but can request a review)?
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;pre style="margin: 0em;"&gt;

thanks.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;pre style="margin: 0em;"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;tt&gt;For security and privacy, we have a self-review at:

&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;For debuggability, here are the survey responses until I find out how 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;to add to the comments at chromestatus:
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;pre style="margin: 0em;"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;tt&gt;(1) Does the introduction of the new Web Platform feature break Chrome 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;DevTools' existing developer experience? No. (2) Does Chrome DevTools' 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;existing set of tooling features interact with the new Web Platform 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;feature in an expected way?
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Yes. (3) Would the new Web Platform feature's acceptance and/or 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;adoption benefit from adding a new developer workflow to Chrome 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;DevTools? Yes. If adopted, this new feature would benefit from new UI 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;and tooling in the Application Page of Chrome DevTools. DevTools 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;support can help developers determine if they have set up the web app 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;association configuration correctly and if their specified 
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;tt&gt;scope_extensions are valid.

            Summary

            Adds a &amp;quot;scope_extensions&amp;quot; app manifest member that
            enables web apps to extend their scope to other origins.
            Example usage: { &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Example&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;display&amp;quot;:
            &amp;quot;standalone&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;start_url&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;/index.html&amp;quot;,
            &amp;quot;scope_extensions&amp;quot;: [ {&amp;quot;origin&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://*.example.com"&gt;https://*.example.com&lt;/a&gt;
            &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="http://example.com"&gt;http://example.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;}, {&amp;quot;origin&amp;quot;:
            &amp;quot;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://example.co.uk&amp;quot"&gt;https://example.co.uk&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://example.co.uk"&gt;https://example.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;},
            {&amp;quot;origin&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://*.example.co.uk"&gt;https://*.example.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;
            &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="http://example.co.uk"&gt;http://example.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;} ] } This allows sites that
            control multiple subdomains and top level domains to be
            presented as a single web app. Requires listed origins to
            confirm association with the web app using a
            .well-known/web-app-origin-association configuration
            file. { &amp;quot;web_apps&amp;quot; : [ {&amp;quot;web_app_identity&amp;quot;:

            WebView application risks

            Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing
            APIs, such that it has potentially high risk for Android
            WebView-based applications?



            Goals for experimentationAllow app partners to experiment
            more broadly with the scope_extensions feature and
            provide feedback. We want to evaluate the shape of the
            scope_extensions API for ease of use and expose any
            corner cases. Specifically, we want to understand if
            origin-level granularity is sufficient without path
            filters. We will evaluate this based on feedback from OT
            participants.

            Ongoing technical constraints

            None.



            Debuggability

            DevTools Application pane will be the appropriate surface
            to add debugging support. Specifically, a section can be
            added to help troubleshoot the status of origin
            association validation. Additionally,
            edge://web-app-internals/ also have relevant information
            for debugging.



            Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms
            (Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android
            WebView)?No

            Supported on Windows, MacOS, Linux, ChromeOS. Not
            supported on mobile platforms where app identity is
            implemented differently.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; While it would obviously be better for the header to only be sent once
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (less bytes transmitted), I don't think sending it twice should cause a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; problem so long as both headers are the same, e.g. they both specify &amp;quot;?0&amp;quot;.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you're seeing the problem with two headers but not with one, then that's
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a bug. In that case filing a bug report at crbug.com, including as much
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; information as possible, would be appreciated.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I tried this with a simple test case on my own server, and it seems to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; work fine.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks James. We are able to add the header from our server's servlet
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; filter code. It now appends the header for each response including static
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; html files. It seems to be working fine so far. There are instances where
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it still gets blocked when a link is opened on new window. I believe we
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; need to make sure the new window response contains the header as well,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? Also, if the header gets duplicated i.e. if the response contains
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the same header twice, it does not work. It looks as if the header is not
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sent at all. Is this how it is supposed to behave?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I think you need to get the server to send the header. Once you get
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; as far as the meta tags, the origin's isolation state has already been
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; decided. I'm not an expert on servers, but my experience in specifying
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; headers to be sent with static pages is to edit the .htaccess file in the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; directory with the content, and include
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HEADER add Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But the exact details will depend on your setup.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This helped us identify the response that did not have the header. We
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; noticed that we have a static html called signon.html as our first entry
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; into the application. Since this is a static html, our servlet changes to

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; think Chrome puts this origin into Origin-keyed cluster at this point and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hence when users login and encounter document.domain, they get the error
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; blocked frame error.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; meta tags with http-equiv does not recognize this custom response

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Perhaps try this:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) open a new tab page (or about:blank if you prefer)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2) right-click and select &amp;quot;Inspect&amp;quot; at the bottom of the popup menu
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 3) in the DevTools menu at the top, click &amp;quot;Network&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4) then check the &amp;quot;Preserve Logs&amp;quot; checkbox in the row under that menu
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5) finally, manually type the url for your app/site in the url bar
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As your content loads, the DevTools window will populate with an (in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; order) list of all the network transactions. You can click on each 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; element
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the list and see the response headers for each request. This should 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; help
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you determine which request is missing the Origin-Agent-Cluster:?0 header
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and causing the origin keying to be applied for the tab.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let me know if that helps.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; An update on the issue I am facing: We have a static html in web
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; server called signon.html. Users access this static html page first 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; which
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; has a refresh directive with content=1. As soon as the user invokes this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; html page first time from the origin, this redirects to a login form 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; page.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This response contains the header too. But still chrome console says the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin was in origin-keyed cluster. If I change the refresh directive
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; content=5, it takes 5 sec to redirect from signon.html to login form, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; time I don't get the console warning. Now I can login and dont see any
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; errors. I am not sure why the refresh directive 5 works but not 1. Is it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because Chrome could not capture request and place the origin in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; appropriate cluster within its 1 second?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Modified the CONTENT=5 from CONTENT=1 in the below line to get it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; working - &amp;lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV='Refresh' CONTENT='5;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks for response. In my case, I am getting the error when a new
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tab is opened from an existing tab. My existing tab did not throw this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; error whereas the new tab shows the error on the first request itself. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; based on what you mentioned, my parent tab should have been part of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Origin-Keyed cluster, right? I am seeing console warning as follows on 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; my
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; new tab that was opened from an existing tab:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;The page did not request an Origin-Keyed agent cluster but was put
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in one anyway because the origin had previously been placed in an
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed agent cluster. Update your headers to uniformly request
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keying for all pages on the origin&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I am currently trying to figure out which server response did not
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; have the header &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0&amp;quot; that led my pages to get in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed cluster. Is there a way (debug tool etc) I can check which
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; response decided Origin-Keying? I think this will be crucial for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; applications to debug the issues.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One other question: My parent tab has a wss (web socket) request
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that does not have its response with this OAC header. Do we need the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; header
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in wss response as well?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If the application is getting loaded inside a tab that has
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; previously loaded other pages from the same origin (i.e. pages not part 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the app) that do not have the header, then for consistency the new loads
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; will get OAC isolation even if the header is present. Essentially, the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; first time the tab loads anything from a particular origin, that 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; determines
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; how it will treat the origin for the remainder of the tab's lifetime. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; consistency will also extend to other tabs opened by the tab (as they 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; live
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the same &amp;quot;BrowsingInstance&amp;quot;).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Also, there may be issues where pages can be loaded from cache
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; without the ?0 version of the header, so two useful steps would be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) Clear the cache, and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2) open the app directly in a newly opened tab.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't think the header needs to be sent on script/css/image
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requests, as they're used within the context of the .html resource that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; should have the header.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I have some of the customers reporting inconsistent behavior. Our
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; application sends  &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0&amp;quot; in response headers
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to opt-out of Origin Agent clusters since we rely on document.domain. Is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this header needed only on document requests or even for script, image, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; css
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requests? For some customer, their pages get inside origin-keyed cluster
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; even though the responses contain the header   &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ?0&amp;quot;. Is there a bug in the chrome behavior that puts pages in specific

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello all, it's been a while... The bug reports should now be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; resolved, and we'd like to have another go at this in the M115 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; milestone.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That is: Remain at 50% on beta; starting with 115 ramp up on stable to 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1% /
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 10% / 50% / 100%, every 14d. Let's hope it sticks this time.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello all, I'm afraid I have to delay this a bit more. :(
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have a bug report (tracked in crbug.com/1429587) that breaks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; existing apps. The important thing here is that it does not break
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain setting and subsequent cross-origin access, but that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; instead -- if the conditions are just right; or arguably just wrong -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; app can get into a state where same-origin accesses are mistakenly 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; blocked.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Apparently an app can get into a state where frames within the same page
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; are inconsistently assigned to agent clusters (i.e., frames in the same
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin end up in different processes), and thus subsequent accesses 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; within
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that origin may fail.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My plan right now is to leave this on at 50% beta, but to not
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; proceed to any stable releases at any percentage. I'll update this 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; thread
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; when I have a better handle on the bug and can suggest a good way to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; proceed.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; post is a good summary

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; critical thing it doesn't mention, but probably should, is that the

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; here, but two milestones later: Launch to 50% beta in M111 (or late 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; M110,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; if I can still catch a bit of that release cycle), and then ramp on 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; stable
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; once M112 is out.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; An update: Unfortunately we have discovered a bug with this feature,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; just as I was getting ready to enable it. The bug also affects pages 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; have not even set document.domain. Since I have now missed a substantial
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; portion of the 109 beta cycle I'd like to delay the roll out once more, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; shift it by one milestone (or two; depending on when everything is 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fixed).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On the positive side: Recently the last of the previously identified
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; big document.domain users, that together accounted for about 50% of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; remaining usage, has dropped their usage. So current usage is lower than
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; previously reported. See the usage dip around late November at
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deprecate.it (1st graph).

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; M109, and carefully roll this out for M110, once it hits stable.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is that separate intent.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A summary of what happened so far:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Shipping Origin Isolation by Default (and thereby deprecating
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain) has security benefits, but compatibility risk.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - We added warnings to the developer console and issues panel,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; published a blog post, and engaged in direct outreach. This has 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; resulted in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; substantial, measurable reduction of usage. Some sites keep using
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain, but have mitigated the deprecation with other means. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; makes the risk difficult to measure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Sampling of sites with document.domain usage and manual inspection
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yields a potential breakage estimate at ~0.015% of page views.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What we're asking for here is:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Enable the feature at 50% for beta (+ dev + canary) during M109,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; as a &amp;quot;last call&amp;quot; for web site authors.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This sounds like a good idea. Is there any reason we couldn't go to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 50% in M108 as well (or are you trying to avoid breakage over the winter
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; holidays)?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No reason. I'd be happy to go to beta as soon as I receive the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; lgtms. I had conservatively budgeted that to be 109. :-)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Another question: do we have enterprise policies available for this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; change?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is a follow-on to the Intent to Ship: Origin Isolation By
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Default / Deprecate document.domain

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We'd
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like to ship this in M110, stable.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary (of the underlying change) Change the default behavior of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the Origin-Agent-Cluster: header / document.domain settability.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Presently, pages within Chromium have site-keyed agent clusters by
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; default, unless the Origin-Agent-Cluster: header is explicitly set to 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; true.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This accommodates pages or frames which want to access each other's 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; state,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; despite being on different origins (but within a site). This is fine for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; any pages that wish to do so, but because a page *might* set
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain later on, Chromium currently must use site-keyed agent
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clusters for *all* pages by default even though the overwhelming 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; majority
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; of pages do not ever make use of this (mis-)feature. In turn, this 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requires
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chromium to use sites as the basis for renderer process isolation (via 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Site
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Isolation), which exposes origins to same-site but cross-origin attacks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; involving compromised renderer processes or the &amp;quot;Spectre&amp;quot; family of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; side-channel attacks.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This proposal changes the default behaviour of Origin-Agent-Cluster.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; From a developer's point of view, the new default matches
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?1&amp;quot;. The initial implementation will use
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed agent clusters for all (non-opted out) origins, without
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; changing how many processes Chromium creates. Over time, we can then 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; adapt
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chromium's isolation strategy towards origin-keyed processes without
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; further affecting web-visible behaviour.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The developer-visible aspect of this is that for pages with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed agent clusters, document.domain is no longer settable. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thus,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; we have marked this intent as a deprecation.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Note that this proposal is about the default. Both modes -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; site-keyed or origin-keyed agent clusters - remain available to any 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; site,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but origin-keyed agent clusters change from opt-in to opt-out. The 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; current
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; behaviour remains available by setting &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0&amp;quot;.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,

duplicate headers in &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://crbug.com/1478065"&gt;https://crbug.com/1478065&lt;/a&gt;, and it turns out to be
required by spec to not allow duplicates.  (See comment 13
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1478065#c13"&gt;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1478065#c13&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; on that
bug.)  I think it will be necessary to only return one copy of the header,
and there's a bug filed &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://crbug.com/1484583"&gt;https://crbug.com/1484583&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; to have DevTools

&amp;gt; While it would obviously be better for the header to only be sent once

&amp;gt; If you're seeing the problem with two headers but not with one, then that's
&amp;gt; a bug. In that case filing a bug report at crbug.com, including as much
&amp;gt; information as possible, would be appreciated.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; I tried this with a simple test case on my own server, and it seems to
&amp;gt; work fine.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks James. We are able to add the header from our server's servlet
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; filter code. It now appends the header for each response including static
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; html files. It seems to be working fine so far. There are instances where
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it still gets blocked when a link is opened on new window. I believe we
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; need to make sure the new window response contains the header as well,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right? Also, if the header gets duplicated i.e. if the response contains
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the same header twice, it does not work. It looks as if the header is not
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sent at all. Is this how it is supposed to behave?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I think you need to get the server to send the header. Once you get
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; as far as the meta tags, the origin's isolation state has already been
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; decided. I'm not an expert on servers, but my experience in specifying
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; headers to be sent with static pages is to edit the .htaccess file in the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; directory with the content, and include
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HEADER add Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But the exact details will depend on your setup.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This helped us identify the response that did not have the header. We
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; noticed that we have a static html called signon.html as our first entry
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; into the application. Since this is a static html, our servlet changes to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; add response header does not hit when users invoke this signon.html. I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; think Chrome puts this origin into Origin-keyed cluster at this point and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hence when users login and encounter document.domain, they get the error
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; blocked frame error.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; meta tags with http-equiv does not recognize this custom response
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; header Origin-Agent-Cluster. Is there a way to add response headers in a

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Perhaps try this:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) open a new tab page (or about:blank if you prefer)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2) right-click and select &amp;quot;Inspect&amp;quot; at the bottom of the popup menu
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 3) in the DevTools menu at the top, click &amp;quot;Network&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4) then check the &amp;quot;Preserve Logs&amp;quot; checkbox in the row under that menu
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5) finally, manually type the url for your app/site in the url bar
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As your content loads, the DevTools window will populate with an (in

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the list and see the response headers for each request. This should 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; help
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you determine which request is missing the Origin-Agent-Cluster:?0 header
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and causing the origin keying to be applied for the tab.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let me know if that helps.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; An update on the issue I am facing: We have a static html in web
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; server called signon.html. Users access this static html page first which
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; has a refresh directive with content=1. As soon as the user invokes this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; html page first time from the origin, this redirects to a login form 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; page.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This response contains the header too. But still chrome console says the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin was in origin-keyed cluster. If I change the refresh directive
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; content=5, it takes 5 sec to redirect from signon.html to login form, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; time I don't get the console warning. Now I can login and dont see any
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; errors. I am not sure why the refresh directive 5 works but not 1. Is it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because Chrome could not capture request and place the origin in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; appropriate cluster within its 1 second?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Modified the CONTENT=5 from CONTENT=1 in the below line to get it

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks for response. In my case, I am getting the error when a new
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tab is opened from an existing tab. My existing tab did not throw this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; error whereas the new tab shows the error on the first request itself. So
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; based on what you mentioned, my parent tab should have been part of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Origin-Keyed cluster, right? I am seeing console warning as follows on my
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; new tab that was opened from an existing tab:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;The page did not request an Origin-Keyed agent cluster but was put
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in one anyway because the origin had previously been placed in an
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed agent cluster. Update your headers to uniformly request
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keying for all pages on the origin&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I am currently trying to figure out which server response did not
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; have the header &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0&amp;quot; that led my pages to get in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed cluster. Is there a way (debug tool etc) I can check which
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; response decided Origin-Keying? I think this will be crucial for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; applications to debug the issues.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One other question: My parent tab has a wss (web socket) request that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; does not have its response with this OAC header. Do we need the header in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; wss response as well?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If the application is getting loaded inside a tab that has previously
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; loaded other pages from the same origin (i.e. pages not part of the app)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that do not have the header, then for consistency the new loads will get

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the tab loads anything from a particular origin, that determines how it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; will treat the origin for the remainder of the tab's lifetime. This
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; consistency will also extend to other tabs opened by the tab (as they

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Also, there may be issues where pages can be loaded from cache
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; without the ?0 version of the header, so two useful steps would be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) Clear the cache, and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2) open the app directly in a newly opened tab.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't think the header needs to be sent on script/css/image
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requests, as they're used within the context of the .html resource that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; should have the header.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi All,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is the feature launched in Chrome 115 as updated in

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I have some of the customers reporting inconsistent behavior. Our
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; application sends  &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0&amp;quot; in response headers to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; opt-out of Origin Agent clusters since we rely on document.domain. Is 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; header needed only on document requests or even for script, image, css
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requests? For some customer, their pages get inside origin-keyed cluster
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; even though the responses contain the header   &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ?0&amp;quot;. Is there a bug in the chrome behavior that puts pages in specific
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cluster? How do we debug what caused the pages to get inside origin-keyed
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cluster?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello all, it's been a while... The bug reports should now be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; resolved, and we'd like to have another go at this in the M115 milestone.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That is: Remain at 50% on beta; starting with 115 ramp up on stable to 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1% /
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 10% / 50% / 100%, every 14d. Let's hope it sticks this time.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello all, I'm afraid I have to delay this a bit more. :(
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have a bug report (tracked in crbug.com/1429587) that breaks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; existing apps. The important thing here is that it does not break
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain setting and subsequent cross-origin access, but that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; instead -- if the conditions are just right; or arguably just wrong -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; app can get into a state where same-origin accesses are mistakenly 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; blocked.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Apparently an app can get into a state where frames within the same page
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; are inconsistently assigned to agent clusters (i.e., frames in the same
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin end up in different processes), and thus subsequent accesses 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; within
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that origin may fail.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My plan right now is to leave this on at 50% beta, but to not proceed
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to any stable releases at any percentage. I'll update this thread when I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; have a better handle on the bug and can suggest a good way to proceed.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; can still catch a bit of that release cycle), and then ramp on stable

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; An update: Unfortunately we have discovered a bug with this feature,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; just as I was getting ready to enable it. The bug also affects pages that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; have not even set document.domain. Since I have now missed a substantial
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; portion of the 109 beta cycle I'd like to delay the roll out once more, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; shift it by one milestone (or two; depending on when everything is 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fixed).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On the positive side: Recently the last of the previously identified
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; big document.domain users, that together accounted for about 50% of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; remaining usage, has dropped their usage. So current usage is lower than
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; previously reported. See the usage dip around late November at
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deprecate.it (1st graph).

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A summary of what happened so far:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Shipping Origin Isolation by Default (and thereby deprecating
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain) has security benefits, but compatibility risk.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - We added warnings to the developer console and issues panel,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; published a blog post, and engaged in direct outreach. This has resulted 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; substantial, measurable reduction of usage. Some sites keep using
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain, but have mitigated the deprecation with other means. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; makes the risk difficult to measure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Sampling of sites with document.domain usage and manual inspection
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yields a potential breakage estimate at ~0.015% of page views.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What we're asking for here is:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Enable the feature at 50% for beta (+ dev + canary) during M109, as
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a &amp;quot;last call&amp;quot; for web site authors.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This sounds like a good idea. Is there any reason we couldn't go to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 50% in M108 as well (or are you trying to avoid breakage over the winter
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; holidays)?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No reason. I'd be happy to go to beta as soon as I receive the lgtms.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I had conservatively budgeted that to be 109. :-)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Another question: do we have enterprise policies available for this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; change?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes; the policy is here: OriginAgentClusterDefaultEnabled

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is a follow-on to the Intent to Ship: Origin Isolation By
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Default / Deprecate document.domain
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/_oRc19PjpFo/"&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/_oRc19PjpFo/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We'd
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like to ship this in M110, stable.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary (of the underlying change) Change the default behavior of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the Origin-Agent-Cluster: header / document.domain settability.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Presently, pages within Chromium have site-keyed agent clusters by
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; default, unless the Origin-Agent-Cluster: header is explicitly set to 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; true.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This accommodates pages or frames which want to access each other's 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; state,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; despite being on different origins (but within a site). This is fine for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; any pages that wish to do so, but because a page *might* set
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain later on, Chromium currently must use site-keyed agent
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clusters for *all* pages by default even though the overwhelming majority
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; of pages do not ever make use of this (mis-)feature. In turn, this 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requires
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chromium to use sites as the basis for renderer process isolation (via 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Site
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Isolation), which exposes origins to same-site but cross-origin attacks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; involving compromised renderer processes or the &amp;quot;Spectre&amp;quot; family of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; side-channel attacks.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This proposal changes the default behaviour of Origin-Agent-Cluster.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; From a developer's point of view, the new default matches
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?1&amp;quot;. The initial implementation will use
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed agent clusters for all (non-opted out) origins, without
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; changing how many processes Chromium creates. Over time, we can then 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; adapt
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chromium's isolation strategy towards origin-keyed processes without
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; further affecting web-visible behaviour.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The developer-visible aspect of this is that for pages with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed agent clusters, document.domain is no longer settable. Thus,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; we have marked this intent as a deprecation.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Note that this proposal is about the default. Both modes - site-keyed
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or origin-keyed agent clusters - remain available to any site, but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed agent clusters change from opt-in to opt-out. The current
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; behaviour remains available by setting &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0&amp;quot;.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There are compatibility risks, which we have reduced with outreach
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and warnings, and we want to mitigate further by launching at 50% of beta
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; first. An extended discussion of the risk (including attempts at
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; quantitative assessment) can be found in the original intent to ship

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)? Yes

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can you explain what this action does and how developers are likely to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; use it?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. In general, websites can register handlers on the Media Session
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for various actions (e.g. &amp;quot;nexttrack&amp;quot;). The UA can then trigger those
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; actions on the page via browser UI or other user actions (e.g. a next track
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; button in the browser native UI or if the user presses the &amp;quot;next track&amp;quot; key
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on their keyboard). For the case of 'enterpictureinpicture', the website
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; would register a handler for that action and the UA can trigger it when
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; appropriate (e.g. Chrome has a picture-in-picture button in its global
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; media controls UI). The website can use that handler to call
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requestPictureInPicture on a video element or request a document
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; picture-in-picture window.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What's blocking the PR from landing?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was waiting on review from the other Media Session author. I pinged
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; them today and have landed the PR.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adds an 'enterpictureinpicture' action to the Media Session API.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Websites can register an action handler which can be used to open a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Picture-in-Picture or Document Picture-in-Picture window.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This small addition to the Media Session API doesn’t seem to qualify
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for a TAG review.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It’s low risk as it's a small addition to an existing API that both
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gecko and WebKit approve of.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Signals from other implementations (Gecko, WebKit):
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gecko: No signal
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebKit: No signal - Generally positive feedback when discussed in the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Media WG, but no official position pursued due to the small nature of the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; change
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Web / Framework developers: Positive

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The above citation is one example amongst many where developers want to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; be able to initiate pip through other means (e.g. automatically when
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; switching tabs or when a picture-in-picture button is pressed in browser
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; UI), and having a media session action for this enables the UA to allow the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; website to open a picture-in-picture window in these cases
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ergonomics:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; N/A: small addition to an enum of an existing API
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Activation:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Web developers will be able to simply set/unset a media session action
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; handler for “enterpictureinpicture” to make use of this change. When the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; action name is not supported, it raises a TypeError which can be caught to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; detect feature support.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody" class="msgBody"&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;While it would obviously be better for the header to only be sent once
(less bytes transmitted), I don't think sending it twice should cause a
problem so long as both headers are the same, e.g. they both specify &amp;quot;?0&amp;quot;.
If you're seeing the problem with two headers but not with one, then that's
a bug. In that case filing a bug report at crbug.com, including as much
information as possible, would be appreciated.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

I tried this with a simple test case on my own server, and it seems to work
fine.

&amp;gt; Thanks James. We are able to add the header from our server's servlet
&amp;gt; filter code. It now appends the header for each response including static
&amp;gt; html files. It seems to be working fine so far. There are instances where
&amp;gt; it still gets blocked when a link is opened on new window. I believe we
&amp;gt; need to make sure the new window response contains the header as well,
&amp;gt; right? Also, if the header gets duplicated i.e. if the response contains
&amp;gt; the same header twice, it does not work. It looks as if the header is not
&amp;gt; sent at all. Is this how it is supposed to behave?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I think you need to get the server to send the header. Once you get
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; as far as the meta tags, the origin's isolation state has already been
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; decided. I'm not an expert on servers, but my experience in specifying
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; headers to be sent with static pages is to edit the .htaccess file in the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; directory with the content, and include
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HEADER add Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But the exact details will depend on your setup.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This helped us identify the response that did not have the header. We
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; noticed that we have a static html called signon.html as our first entry
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; into the application. Since this is a static html, our servlet changes to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; add response header does not hit when users invoke this signon.html. I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; think Chrome puts this origin into Origin-keyed cluster at this point and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hence when users login and encounter document.domain, they get the error
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; blocked frame error.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; meta tags with http-equiv does not recognize this custom response header
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Origin-Agent-Cluster. Is there a way to add response headers in a static

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Perhaps try this:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) open a new tab page (or about:blank if you prefer)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2) right-click and select &amp;quot;Inspect&amp;quot; at the bottom of the popup menu
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 3) in the DevTools menu at the top, click &amp;quot;Network&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4) then check the &amp;quot;Preserve Logs&amp;quot; checkbox in the row under that menu
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5) finally, manually type the url for your app/site in the url bar
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As your content loads, the DevTools window will populate with an (in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; order) list of all the network transactions. You can click on each element
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the list and see the response headers for each request. This should help
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; you determine which request is missing the Origin-Agent-Cluster:?0 header
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and causing the origin keying to be applied for the tab.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let me know if that helps.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; An update on the issue I am facing: We have a static html in web
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; server called signon.html. Users access this static html page first which
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; has a refresh directive with content=1. As soon as the user invokes this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; html page first time from the origin, this redirects to a login form page.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This response contains the header too. But still chrome console says the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin was in origin-keyed cluster. If I change the refresh directive
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; content=5, it takes 5 sec to redirect from signon.html to login form, this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; time I don't get the console warning. Now I can login and dont see any
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; errors. I am not sure why the refresh directive 5 works but not 1. Is it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; because Chrome could not capture request and place the origin in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; appropriate cluster within its 1 second?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Modified the CONTENT=5 from CONTENT=1 in the below line to get it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; working - &amp;lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV='Refresh' CONTENT='5;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks for response. In my case, I am getting the error when a new tab
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is opened from an existing tab. My existing tab did not throw this error
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; whereas the new tab shows the error on the first request itself. So based
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on what you mentioned, my parent tab should have been part of Origin-Keyed
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cluster, right? I am seeing console warning as follows on my new tab that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; was opened from an existing tab:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;The page did not request an Origin-Keyed agent cluster but was put in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; one anyway because the origin had previously been placed in an 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; agent cluster. Update your headers to uniformly request origin-keying for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; all pages on the origin&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I am currently trying to figure out which server response did not have
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the header &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0&amp;quot; that led my pages to get in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed cluster. Is there a way (debug tool etc) I can check which
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; response decided Origin-Keying? I think this will be crucial for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; applications to debug the issues.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One other question: My parent tab has a wss (web socket) request that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; does not have its response with this OAC header. Do we need the header in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; wss response as well?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If the application is getting loaded inside a tab that has previously
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; loaded other pages from the same origin (i.e. pages not part of the app)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that do not have the header, then for consistency the new loads will get
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OAC isolation even if the header is present. Essentially, the first time
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the tab loads anything from a particular origin, that determines how it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; will treat the origin for the remainder of the tab's lifetime. This
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; consistency will also extend to other tabs opened by the tab (as they live
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the same &amp;quot;BrowsingInstance&amp;quot;).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Also, there may be issues where pages can be loaded from cache without
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the ?0 version of the header, so two useful steps would be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) Clear the cache, and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2) open the app directly in a newly opened tab.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't think the header needs to be sent on script/css/image
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requests, as they're used within the context of the .html resource that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; should have the header.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I have some of the customers reporting inconsistent behavior. Our
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; application sends  &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0&amp;quot; in response headers to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; opt-out of Origin Agent clusters since we rely on document.domain. Is this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; header needed only on document requests or even for script, image, css
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requests? For some customer, their pages get inside origin-keyed cluster
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; even though the responses contain the header   &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ?0&amp;quot;. Is there a bug in the chrome behavior that puts pages in specific
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cluster? How do we debug what caused the pages to get inside origin-keyed

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello all, I'm afraid I have to delay this a bit more. :(
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have a bug report (tracked in crbug.com/1429587) that breaks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; existing apps. The important thing here is that it does not break
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain setting and subsequent cross-origin access, but that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; instead -- if the conditions are just right; or arguably just wrong -- the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; app can get into a state where same-origin accesses are mistakenly 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; blocked.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Apparently an app can get into a state where frames within the same page
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; are inconsistently assigned to agent clusters (i.e., frames in the same
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin end up in different processes), and thus subsequent accesses within
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that origin may fail.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My plan right now is to leave this on at 50% beta, but to not proceed
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to any stable releases at any percentage. I'll update this thread when I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; have a better handle on the bug and can suggest a good way to proceed.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In case others, like me, have missed or forgotten the long history of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this difficult deprecation and what it means for web developers, this blog
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; post is a good summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/immutable-document-domain/"&gt;https://developer.chrome.com/blog/immutable-document-domain/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;. One
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; critical thing it doesn't mention, but probably should, is that the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OriginAgentClusterDefaultEnabled
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; enterprise policy
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#OriginAgentClusterDefaultEnabled"&gt;https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#OriginAgentClusterDefaultEnabled&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; can also be used to revert the default on managed devices (though it looks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like the launching milestone needs to be updated there too).

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello all,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We've now handled the bugs we've discovered, and I would like to make
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; another attempt at launching. I'll follow the plan that was approved here,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; but two milestones later: Launch to 50% beta in M111 (or late M110, if I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; can still catch a bit of that release cycle), and then ramp on stable once
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; M112 is out.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello all,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; An update: Unfortunately we have discovered a bug with this feature,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; just as I was getting ready to enable it. The bug also affects pages that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; have not even set document.domain. Since I have now missed a substantial
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; portion of the 109 beta cycle I'd like to delay the roll out once more, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; shift it by one milestone (or two; depending on when everything is fixed).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; On the positive side: Recently the last of the previously identified
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; big document.domain users, that together accounted for about 50% of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; remaining usage, has dropped their usage. So current usage is lower than
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; previously reported. See the usage dip around late November at
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deprecate.it (1st graph).

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The approval for the Intent To Ship for Origin Isolation By Default /
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Deprecate document.domain

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; asks for a separate intent for the actual default change
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/_oRc19PjpFo/m/Ybgtf3JfAQAJ"&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/_oRc19PjpFo/m/Ybgtf3JfAQAJ&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is that separate intent.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A summary of what happened so far:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Shipping Origin Isolation by Default (and thereby deprecating
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain) has security benefits, but compatibility risk.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - We added warnings to the developer console and issues panel,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; published a blog post, and engaged in direct outreach. This has resulted 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; substantial, measurable reduction of usage. Some sites keep using
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain, but have mitigated the deprecation with other means. This
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; makes the risk difficult to measure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Sampling of sites with document.domain usage and manual inspection
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; yields a potential breakage estimate at ~0.015% of page views.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What we're asking for here is:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Enable the feature at 50% for beta (+ dev + canary) during M109, as
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a &amp;quot;last call&amp;quot; for web site authors.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This sounds like a good idea. Is there any reason we couldn't go to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 50% in M108 as well (or are you trying to avoid breakage over the winter
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; holidays)?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No reason. I'd be happy to go to beta as soon as I receive the lgtms.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I had conservatively budgeted that to be 109. :-)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Another question: do we have enterprise policies available for this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; change?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes; the policy is here: OriginAgentClusterDefaultEnabled
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/policy/resources/templates/policy_definitions/Miscellaneous/OriginAgentClusterDefaultEnabled.yaml"&gt;https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/policy/resources/templates/policy_definitions/Miscellaneous/OriginAgentClusterDefaultEnabled.yaml&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Launch on stable on M110. (~ Feb '23, so &amp;gt;12 weeks out from today)

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is a follow-on to the Intent to Ship: Origin Isolation By
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Default / Deprecate document.domain
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/_oRc19PjpFo/"&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/_oRc19PjpFo/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We'd
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like to ship this in M110, stable.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary (of the underlying change) Change the default behavior of the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Origin-Agent-Cluster: header / document.domain settability.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Presently, pages within Chromium have site-keyed agent clusters by
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; default, unless the Origin-Agent-Cluster: header is explicitly set to 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; true.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This accommodates pages or frames which want to access each other's state,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; despite being on different origins (but within a site). This is fine for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; any pages that wish to do so, but because a page *might* set
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; document.domain later on, Chromium currently must use site-keyed agent
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clusters for *all* pages by default even though the overwhelming majority
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; of pages do not ever make use of this (mis-)feature. In turn, this 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requires
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chromium to use sites as the basis for renderer process isolation (via 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Site
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Isolation), which exposes origins to same-site but cross-origin attacks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; involving compromised renderer processes or the &amp;quot;Spectre&amp;quot; family of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; side-channel attacks.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This proposal changes the default behaviour of Origin-Agent-Cluster.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; From a developer's point of view, the new default matches
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?1&amp;quot;. The initial implementation will use
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed agent clusters for all (non-opted out) origins, without
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; changing how many processes Chromium creates. Over time, we can then adapt
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chromium's isolation strategy towards origin-keyed processes without
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; further affecting web-visible behaviour.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The developer-visible aspect of this is that for pages with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed agent clusters, document.domain is no longer settable. Thus,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; we have marked this intent as a deprecation.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Note that this proposal is about the default. Both modes - site-keyed
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or origin-keyed agent clusters - remain available to any site, but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origin-keyed agent clusters change from opt-in to opt-out. The current
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; behaviour remains available by setting &amp;quot;Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?0&amp;quot;.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Risks: Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There are compatibility risks, which we have reduced with outreach and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; warnings, and we want to mitigate further by launching at 50% of beta
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; first. An extended discussion of the risk (including attempts at
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; quantitative assessment) can be found in the original intent to ship

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;   Security This change should be security-positive, since setting

&lt;pre&gt;Hi,

We have the same problem as described here:&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1457567"&gt;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1457567&lt;/a&gt;

When will be fixed this ?

&amp;gt; Sure, I'm saying that old -webkit-background-clip works with keywords: 
&amp;gt; border, content, padding. The new one - background-clip works with 
&amp;gt; border-box, content-box, padding-box. 
&amp;gt; So, per compat spec -webkit-background-clip should be alias to 
&amp;gt; background-clip. But since the keywords are different, in order to handle 
&amp;gt; round trip better (e.g. setting -webkit-background-clip to content would 
&amp;gt; read back content-box, as it's an alias to background-clip), we want to 
&amp;gt; drop support of old keywords without -box for -webkit-background-clip. To 
&amp;gt; see how bad that would we've set up use counters. 
&amp;gt; The biggest one is 0.08%. I've manually checked 80% of the websites 
&amp;gt; reported by that use counter, but found that all of them use *-box 
&amp;gt; keywords, and only one uses -webkit-background-clip: content.
&amp;gt; So I think it's safe to remove support for old keywords.
&amp;gt; Hope it's more clear now.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can you clarify exactly what this means? I'm perfectly fine with lgtm-ing 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; unprefixing and adding a (temporary?) alias for the old keyword, but if we 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; start removing support for keywords we need to be more careful and I want 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to be sure I understand.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In css-backgrounds-4 also added `border` value, should we support it

&lt;pre&gt;Are there official and up-to-date standards positions from Firefox and
Webkit about picture-in-picture in general? (setting aside document
picture-in-picture). The Mozilla position from quite a while ago is
&amp;quot;defer&amp;quot;. If not, and you think their stance might have changed, please file
a new position request for picture-in-picture generally.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Please update your chromestatus entry to trigger the other 5 review
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; categories for this intent. I think it's probably the case that you ended

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can you explain what this action does and how developers are likely to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; use it?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. In general, websites can register handlers on the Media Session for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; various actions (e.g. &amp;quot;nexttrack&amp;quot;). The UA can then trigger those actions
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on the page via browser UI or other user actions (e.g. a next track
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; button in the browser native UI or if the user presses the &amp;quot;next track&amp;quot; key
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on their keyboard). For the case of 'enterpictureinpicture', the website
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; would register a handler for that action and the UA can trigger it when
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; appropriate (e.g. Chrome has a picture-in-picture button in its global
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; media controls UI). The website can use that handler to call
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requestPictureInPicture on a video element or request a document
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; picture-in-picture window.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was waiting on review from the other Media Session author. I pinged
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; them today and have landed the PR.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adds an 'enterpictureinpicture' action to the Media Session API.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Websites can register an action handler which can be used to open a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Picture-in-Picture or Document Picture-in-Picture window.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TAG review
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This small addition to the Media Session API doesn’t seem to qualify for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a TAG review.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Debuggability

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No DevTools changes are required, treated like any other attribute/enum.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It’s low risk as it's a small addition to an existing API that both
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gecko and WebKit approve of.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Signals from other implementations (Gecko, WebKit):
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gecko: No signal
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebKit: No signal - Generally positive feedback when discussed in the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Media WG, but no official position pursued due to the small nature of the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; change
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Web / Framework developers: Positive
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/document-picture-in-picture/issues/96"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/document-picture-in-picture/issues/96&lt;/a&gt;)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The above citation is one example amongst many where developers want to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; be able to initiate pip through other means (e.g. automatically when
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; switching tabs or when a picture-in-picture button is pressed in browser
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; UI), and having a media session action for this enables the UA to allow the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; website to open a picture-in-picture window in these cases
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ergonomics:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; N/A: small addition to an enum of an existing API
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Activation:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Web developers will be able to simply set/unset a media session action
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; handler for “enterpictureinpicture” to make use of this change. When the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; action name is not supported, it raises a TypeError which can be caught to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; detect feature support.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?

Great questions! Fergal - can you answer that?

Also, Vlad previously asked about the recommended pattern for folks to
handle credential revocation with BFCache and his concerns with the snippet
suggested upthread. It'd be great to address that.


&amp;gt; Thanks!

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    - The risky scenario is one where revocation of sensitive info
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    (logout, access revoked) happens on the server-side only without a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    client-side update.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    - In such a scenario on a shared computer, someone could back-button
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    their way into someone else's sensitive info.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    - It might be interesting to talk to security folks (and maybe
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Project Zero folks) to see if this is not happening already with content
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    that's not CCNS decorated.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    - It would be good to run a survey of potentially-sensitive services
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    and try to get a signal from them on how many of them are properly doing
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    revocation on the client side.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       - I'd love ideas on how we can scale such a survey beyond manual
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       inspection of a few known services.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    - It could be interesting to try and ship a version of this with a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    shorter timeout, to minimize the risk of users leaving the machine
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    unattended.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       - If we go that route, it'd be good to think through how we'd be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       able to increase that timeout over time, after gaining more confidence 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       the risky scenario isn't happening in the wild.

&amp;gt; FWIW we don't ship this (outside of the nightly channel), so not sure

Yes, I corrected that in my previous reply and updated the chromestatus

&amp;gt; &amp;gt;         Summary
&amp;gt; &amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Supports using the &amp;lt;image&amp;gt; syntax for custom properties registered with
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; @property or registerProperty(). The &amp;lt;image&amp;gt; syntax can be used to
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; restrict values of the custom property to url() values and generated
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; images like gradients.
&amp;gt; &amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; This syntax was initially excluded from the valid syntaxes mainly
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; because images were not interpolable and that it would add to the
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; usefulness of the syntax to be able to interpolate directly on the
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; custom property. The other engines have shipped the image syntax without
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; supporting interpolation. There are two interpolation methods in css-
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; image-4, cross-fade() and per stop interpolation for gradients. The
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; gradient interpolation is not shipped by any browser (even for standard
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; properties). Safari ships a non-standard compliant cross-fade()
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; interpolation for standard properties (at least for background-image),
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; but not for the registered custom properties.
&amp;gt; &amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; We have an OKR to look into cross-fade() for Q4. If we end up shipping
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; that, it will work for both registered custom properties and standard
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; properties.
&amp;gt; &amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; The &amp;lt;image&amp;gt; syntax for registered custom properties is part of Interop
&amp;gt; 2023.

&lt;pre&gt;I just discussed this with Fergal offline:

   - The risky scenario is one where revocation of sensitive info (logout,
   access revoked) happens on the server-side only without a client-side
   update.
   - In such a scenario on a shared computer, someone could back-button
   their way into someone else's sensitive info.
   - It might be interesting to talk to security folks (and maybe Project
   Zero folks) to see if this is not happening already with content that's not
   CCNS decorated.
   - It would be good to run a survey of potentially-sensitive services and
   try to get a signal from them on how many of them are properly doing
   revocation on the client side.
      - I'd love ideas on how we can scale such a survey beyond manual
      inspection of a few known services.
   - It could be interesting to try and ship a version of this with a
   shorter timeout, to minimize the risk of users leaving the machine
   unattended.
      - If we go that route, it'd be good to think through how we'd be able
      to increase that timeout over time, after gaining more
confidence that the
      risky scenario isn't happening in the wild.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&amp;gt; At this morning's API Owners meeting, they asked me to add all review gate

&amp;gt; Security, Enterprise, Debuggability, and Testing gates to your feature
&amp;gt; entry.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Please click the gate chips in the &amp;quot;Prepare to ship&amp;quot; stage on your feature
&amp;gt; detail page.  For each one, answer survey questions and request that of the
&amp;gt; cross-functional review.  You can request them all in parallel.  In cases
&amp;gt; where you already have the go/launch &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://goto.google.com/launch"&gt;https://goto.google.com/launch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; bit

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think a bug in ChromeStatus may have caused some confusion on this
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; feature entry.  The feature entry has type &amp;quot;Web developer facing code
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; change&amp;quot;, so its bilnk-dev thread should have had subject line prefix
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Web-facing change PSA&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;Intent to ship&amp;quot;.  And, according to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the launching-features doc
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features/#psa-prepare-to-ship"&gt;https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features/#psa-prepare-to-ship&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it does not require any approvals, which is why there are no other gates
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; offered in the ChromeStatus UI.  A fix for that subject-line prefix bug
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; should go live today.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Of course, the point of a PSA is to allow concerns to be raised and I see
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that this is a very active thread.  So, all that should be worked through.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Its a mater of the the API Owners prerogative to request any other reviews
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that they think are appropriate, but it is not automatically required by
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the process for this feature type.  Also, I see that the launch entry
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://launch.corp.google.com/launch/4251651"&gt;https://launch.corp.google.com/launch/4251651&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; had some approvals.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Please update your chromestatus entry to trigger the other 5 review

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can you explain what this action does and how developers are likely to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; use it?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Sure. In general, websites can register handlers on the Media Session for
&amp;gt; various actions (e.g. &amp;quot;nexttrack&amp;quot;). The UA can then trigger those actions
&amp;gt; on the page via browser UI or other user actions (e.g. a next track
&amp;gt; button in the browser native UI or if the user presses the &amp;quot;next track&amp;quot; key
&amp;gt; on their keyboard). For the case of 'enterpictureinpicture', the website
&amp;gt; would register a handler for that action and the UA can trigger it when
&amp;gt; appropriate (e.g. Chrome has a picture-in-picture button in its global
&amp;gt; media controls UI). The website can use that handler to call
&amp;gt; requestPictureInPicture on a video element or request a document
&amp;gt; picture-in-picture window.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What's blocking the PR from landing?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; I was waiting on review from the other Media Session author. I pinged them
&amp;gt; today and have landed the PR.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adds an 'enterpictureinpicture' action to the Media Session API. Websites
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; can register an action handler which can be used to open a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Picture-in-Picture or Document Picture-in-Picture window.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TAG review
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This small addition to the Media Session API doesn’t seem to qualify for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a TAG review.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Note that one for video conferencing actions was approved previously at
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/608"&gt;https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/608&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Debuggability
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No DevTools changes are required, treated like any other attribute/enum.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It’s low risk as it's a small addition to an existing API that both Gecko
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and WebKit approve of.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Signals from other implementations (Gecko, WebKit):
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gecko: No signal
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebKit: No signal - Generally positive feedback when discussed in the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Media WG, but no official position pursued due to the small nature of the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; change
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Web / Framework developers: Positive
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/document-picture-in-picture/issues/96"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/document-picture-in-picture/issues/96&lt;/a&gt;)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The above citation is one example amongst many where developers want to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; be able to initiate pip through other means (e.g. automatically when
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; switching tabs or when a picture-in-picture button is pressed in browser
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; UI), and having a media session action for this enables the UA to allow the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; website to open a picture-in-picture window in these cases
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ergonomics:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; N/A: small addition to an enum of an existing API
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Activation:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Web developers will be able to simply set/unset a media session action
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; handler for “enterpictureinpicture” to make use of this change. When the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; action name is not supported, it raises a TypeError which can be caught to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; detect feature support.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?

&lt;pre&gt;Hi Lee,

I'm glad you were able to patch the error ahead of a more general rollout!&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

Regarding your second point, there's two ways you can explicitly turn on
the feature:
1. If there's a &amp;quot;Flag name on chrome://flags&amp;quot; in the Intent to Experiment,
you can manually turn on the feature by navigating to chrome://flags. So in
this case, you could force your browser to turn on
chrome://flags/#enable-zstd-content-encoding.
2. If there's a &amp;quot;Finch feature name&amp;quot;, you can pass
`--enable-features=FeatureName` (i.e.
`--enable-features=ZstdContentEncoding` in this case) when running Chrome
from the command line.

You can also keep an eye out for ongoing experiments and planned features
at &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://chromestatus.com/roadmap"&gt;https://chromestatus.com/roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.

Hopefully that helps.

Regards,
Nidhi

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; So two things:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; 1. Firstly, thanks for bringing this this our attention! We were able to
&amp;gt; patch the error ahead of a more general roll-out to public users.
&amp;gt; 2. Is there a way we can explicitly opt in to these kinds of A/B tests to
&amp;gt; preemptively catch more of these breaking changes?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; This would be particularly useful to our synthetics.
&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Zstandard, or “zstd”, is a data compression mechanism described in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RFC8878. It is a fast lossless compression algorithm, targeting real-time
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression ratios. The
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;zstd&amp;quot; token was added as an IANA-registered Content-Encoding token as per
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8878#name-content-encoding"&gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8878#name-content-encoding&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adding support for &amp;quot;zstd&amp;quot; as a Content-Encoding will help load pages faster
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and use less bandwidth.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Servers that have a broken implementation of zstd might exist, but the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; risk of this is small. Additionally, middleware and middleboxes like virus
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; checkers that intercept HTTPS connections might not support zstd, but might
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fail to remove it from the Accept-Encoding header in the request.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Web developers*: Positive (&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://crbug.com/1246971"&gt;https://crbug.com/1246971&lt;/a&gt;) Facebook (Yann)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and Akamai (Nic) seem to be positive about zstd content-encoding in the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; browser. Facebook is also excited to test the feature.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Other signals*:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Security
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CRIME and BREACH mean that the resource being compressed can be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; considered readable by the document deploying them. That is bad if any of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; them contains information that the document cannot already obtain by other
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; means. An attacker may provide correctly formed compressed frames with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; unreasonable memory requirements, and dictionaries may interact
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; unexpectedly with a decoder, leading to possible memory or other
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; resource-exhaustion attacks. It is possible to store arbitrary user
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; metadata in skippable frames, so they can be used as a watermark to track
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the path of the compressed payload. It is important to note that these
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; concerns apply to all compression formats, not just zstd.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; To mitigate these risks, similar to Brotli, we'll be advertising support
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for &amp;quot;zstd&amp;quot; encoding only if transferred data is opaque to proxy, to ensure
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that resources don't contain private data that the origin cannot read
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; otherwise.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adding zstd to Chromium adds a large new code surface that processes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; untrusted data, which inevitably brings risks of new security holes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; However, this is mitigated by the extensive fuzzing and security analysis
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; done on zstd by Google and other community members.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebView application risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Goals for experimentation Understand the impact of supporting zstd
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; content-encoding in the browser on performance and if there's breakage.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ongoing technical constraints
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Debuggability
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No special support needed. Zstd content-encoding support will be exposed
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to the devtools protocol, so developers are able to override it and view
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the headers from the inspector.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)? Yes

&amp;gt; Hi,
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; While Alex's concerns are totally valid to consider from a feature design
&amp;gt; perspective, I think they are better to be discussed on the WHATWG issues
&amp;gt; for this feature. I chatted offline with Alex and he agreed about that
&amp;gt; point, and agreed to post comments and questions there.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; So from an API owners perspective LGTM1 modulo considering and taking into
&amp;gt; account all comments and feedback from Alex on the spec (as we should for
&amp;gt; all such feedback from anyone, of course!).

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; I don't understand why you find this strange, or a footgun. It's intended
&amp;gt; to be the opposite: it guides developers toward creating the experience the
&amp;gt; user expects, where when the user requests to close something, the last
&amp;gt; thing that was opened, is what closes.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Chris Palmer covered this pretty well recently, so I'll defer to his more
&amp;gt; eloquent writeup:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://noncombatant.org/2023/05/29/complexities-of-allocation/"&gt;https://noncombatant.org/2023/05/29/complexities-of-allocation/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Basically, this is spooky action at a distance and without _at least_ some
&amp;gt; reflection and manipulation surface (via DOM, probably), it's hard to
&amp;gt; understand how this won't turn into a footgun.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; As a separate note, I'm disappointed in the proliferation of APIs that
&amp;gt; affect DOM but have no API and reflection. Import Maps spring to mind, but
&amp;gt; there are other recent examples too. If manual disposal is going to be
&amp;gt; required for this, we should at least make it possible to introspect
&amp;gt; outside the scope in which an object that defines this behaviour is
&amp;gt; allocated.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; In what way does this API affect the DOM? No parts of the DOM tree are
&amp;gt; modified by CloseWatcher. The same is true for import maps...
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; This is view state, which is frequently reflected via DOM. The primary
&amp;gt; concern here is that there's no way to inspect and/or modify the stack
&amp;gt; (attached to Node instances or not) independently of closure-scoped object
&amp;gt; lifetimes.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; It's not clear to me what definition of &amp;quot;view state&amp;quot; you are using, such
&amp;gt; that it encompasses things like the module specifier resolution algorithm
&amp;gt; or the routing of Android back gestures.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Maybe, if this is a principle you believe in, you could file it as a
&amp;gt; suggestion on the w3ctag/design-principles repository, ideally with a clear
&amp;gt; explanation of what the boundaries of this &amp;quot;view state&amp;quot; concept are.
&amp;gt; (Including what, in your view, would *not* quality as view state.)
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; The TAG feedback didn't touch on this very much, AFAICT, but it's somewhat
&amp;gt; surprising that the stack of close actions isn't inspectable.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; I can't speak for the TAG, but here are the reasons why the stack of close
&amp;gt; watchers isn't inspectable:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;    - We received no developer or partner feedback requesting this
&amp;gt;    capability
&amp;gt;    - This could cause potential forward-compat problems without careful
&amp;gt;    design. E.g., it could make it possible for developers to write code that
&amp;gt;    assumes that only CloseWatchers, dialogs, and popover=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; elements are close
&amp;gt;    watchers, and thus make it hard for the web platform to introduce a fourth
&amp;gt;    close watcher (e.g., &amp;lt;selectlist&amp;gt;) in the future.
&amp;gt;    - This would be somewhat of an encapsulation leak between different
&amp;gt;    parts of the application, making it harder to write resilient components.
&amp;gt;    (This is not a strong argument, but rather a bias toward waiting for a use
&amp;gt;    case instead of just exposing the information automatically.)
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Thanks, I appreciate the context, and I am impressed by the thoroughness
&amp;gt; of the design artifacts.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; What's the behaviour of non-`destroy()`'d watchers; e.g. if a developer
&amp;gt; forgets to dispose of one correctly? Can users get stuck?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Non-destroy()ed is the default state of a CloseWatcher, so such
&amp;gt; CloseWatchers will respond to the next close request if they are on the top
&amp;gt; of the stack. The user cannot really get stuck, as every close request will
&amp;gt; either destroy the topmost close watcher on the stack, or possibly trigger
&amp;gt; (at most once) a preventDefault()ed cancel event. See
&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher/blob/main/README.md#abuse-analysis"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher/blob/main/README.md#abuse-analysis&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; for more details.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Also helpful; thank you!
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Note that the API generally guides you away from this possibility by
&amp;gt; making the simpler code be the one that automatically calls destroy() for
&amp;gt; you: &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher/blob/main/README"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher/blob/main/README&lt;/a&gt;.

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Close requests&amp;quot; are a new concept that encompasses user requests to close
&amp;gt; something currently open, using the Esc key on desktop or the back
&amp;gt; gesture/button on Android. Integrating them into Chromium comes with two
&amp;gt; changes: * CloseWatcher, a new API for directly listening and responding to
&amp;gt; close requests. * Upgrades to &amp;lt;dialog&amp;gt; and popover=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; to use the new close
&amp;gt; request framework, so that they respond to the Android back button.

&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; This API is designed to have an interoperable surface for web developers,
&amp;gt; to help them avoid platform-specific code. So, if it were implemented
&amp;gt; across browsers, it would be a positive for interoperability. Otherwise, it
&amp;gt; has the usual risks of not getting adopted by other vendors. Compatibility:
&amp;gt; To avoid allowing CloseWatchers, dialogs, and popovers (&amp;quot;close watchers&amp;quot;)
&amp;gt; to prevent the Android back gesture/button from navigating through history,
&amp;gt; how close watchers respond to close requests depends on user activation. If
&amp;gt; no user activation occurs between opening, and the user issuing a close
&amp;gt; request, this can cause a CloseWatcher/dialog's cancel event to be skipped,
&amp;gt; or cause multiple close watchers to be closed at once. Although this
&amp;gt; behavior is meant to prevent back-trapping on Android specifically, it
&amp;gt; applies to desktop as well, for interoperability reasons. This change is a
&amp;gt; compatibility risk. However, use counters show it to be an acceptable one:
&amp;gt; - 0.000015% of pages impacted by skipped cancel events - 0.000007% of pages
&amp;gt; impacted by skipped cancel events that would otherwise call
&amp;gt; preventDefault() - between 0.000000% and 0.000001% of pages impacted by
&amp;gt; multiple dialogs closed

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; *Other signals*:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Activation
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; The CloseWatcher API is meant to be usable as a progressive enhancement;
&amp;gt; if developers use it with feature detection, then their app will be able to
&amp;gt; watch for unusual close watchers in supporting browsers, while falling back
&amp;gt; to listening for the Esc key in browsers that haven't implemented the API.
&amp;gt; It would benefit from a conditional polyfill that translates the Esc key
&amp;gt; into a close signal, so that then developers don't even have to have
&amp;gt; feature detection and fallback logic, but can just use the CloseWatcher API
&amp;gt; surface. One such polyfill is available in the demo:
&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://close-watcher-demo.glitch.me/"&gt;https://close-watcher-demo.glitch.me/&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Security
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; The main security-related concern in this API is preventing it from being
&amp;gt; usable for back-trapping, i.e. disabling the Android back gesture/button.
&amp;gt; Although this is already possible in Chromium and other browsers due to
&amp;gt; bugs, we worked to ensure CloseWatcher and close request integration to
&amp;gt; dialogs/popups does not increase the size of the problem, by gating
&amp;gt; repeated use of these behind transient user activation checks: see
&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher#abuse-analysis"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher#abuse-analysis&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; WebView application risks
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
&amp;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Beyond the low risks already listed in the Compat section, we do not
&amp;gt; anticipate any WebView-specific risks. A base::Feature killswitch is
&amp;gt; available just in case.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Debuggability
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; No special DevTools support is required.
&amp;gt;

&amp;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?Yes

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Can you explain what this action does and how developers are likely to use
&amp;gt; it?
&amp;gt;

Sure. In general, websites can register handlers on the Media Session for
various actions (e.g. &amp;quot;nexttrack&amp;quot;). The UA can then trigger those actions
on the page via browser UI or other user actions (e.g. a next track
button in the browser native UI or if the user presses the &amp;quot;next track&amp;quot; key
on their keyboard). For the case of 'enterpictureinpicture', the website
would register a handler for that action and the UA can trigger it when
appropriate (e.g. Chrome has a picture-in-picture button in its global
media controls UI). The website can use that handler to call
requestPictureInPicture on a video element or request a document
picture-in-picture window.

&amp;gt; What's blocking the PR from landing?
&amp;gt;

I was waiting on review from the other Media Session author. I pinged them
today and have landed the PR.


&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; API spec
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Yes
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Adds an 'enterpictureinpicture' action to the Media Session API. Websites
&amp;gt; can register an action handler which can be used to open a
&amp;gt; Picture-in-Picture or Document Picture-in-Picture window.

&amp;gt; TAG review
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; This small addition to the Media Session API doesn’t seem to qualify for a
&amp;gt; TAG review.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Note that one for video conferencing actions was approved previously at
&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/608"&gt;https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/608&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Debuggability
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; No DevTools changes are required, treated like any other attribute/enum.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt; It’s low risk as it's a small addition to an existing API that both Gecko
&amp;gt; and WebKit approve of.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Signals from other implementations (Gecko, WebKit):
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Gecko: No signal
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; WebKit: No signal - Generally positive feedback when discussed in the
&amp;gt; Media WG, but no official position pursued due to the small nature of the
&amp;gt; change
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Web / Framework developers: Positive
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; (&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/document-picture-in-picture/issues/96"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/document-picture-in-picture/issues/96&lt;/a&gt;)
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; The above citation is one example amongst many where developers want to be
&amp;gt; able to initiate pip through other means (e.g. automatically when switching
&amp;gt; tabs or when a picture-in-picture button is pressed in browser UI), and
&amp;gt; having a media session action for this enables the UA to allow the website
&amp;gt; to open a picture-in-picture window in these cases
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Ergonomics:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; N/A: small addition to an enum of an existing API
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Activation:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Web developers will be able to simply set/unset a media session action
&amp;gt; handler for “enterpictureinpicture” to make use of this change. When the
&amp;gt; action name is not supported, it raises a TypeError which can be caught to
&amp;gt; detect feature support.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?

&lt;pre&gt;For the 3 review categories in chromestatus (security, privacy, and 
debuggability), I have clicked on request review but have not found a way 
to post comments from the UI.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

For security and privacy, we have a self-review at:  
manifest-incubations/scope_extensions-security-privacy-questionnaire.md 
at gh-pages · WICG/manifest-incubations (github.com) 
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/manifest-incubations/blob/gh-pages/scope_extensions-security-privacy-questionnaire.md"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/manifest-incubations/blob/gh-pages/scope_extensions-security-privacy-questionnaire.md&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
For debuggability, here are the survey responses until I find out how to 
add to the comments at chromestatus:

(1) Does the introduction of the new Web Platform feature break Chrome 
DevTools' existing developer experience? No. (2) Does Chrome DevTools' 
existing set of tooling features interact with the new Web Platform feature 
in an expected way?
Yes. (3) Would the new Web Platform feature's acceptance and/or adoption 
benefit from adding a new developer workflow to Chrome DevTools? Yes. If 
adopted, this new feature would benefit from new UI and tooling in the 
Application Page of Chrome DevTools. DevTools support can help developers 
determine if they have set up the web app association configuration 
correctly and if their specified scope_extensions are valid.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Goals for experimentationAllow app partners to experiment more broadly 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; with the scope_extensions feature and provide feedback. We want to evaluate 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the shape of the scope_extensions API for ease of use and expose any corner 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cases. Specifically, we want to understand if origin-level granularity is 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sufficient without path filters. We will evaluate this based on feedback 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from OT participants.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; debugging support. Specifically, a section can be added to help 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; troubleshoot the status of origin association validation. Additionally, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; edge://web-app-internals/ also have relevant information for debugging.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adds a &amp;quot;scope_extensions&amp;quot; app manifest member that enables web apps to 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; extend their scope to other origins. Example usage: { &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Example&amp;quot;, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;display&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;standalone&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;start_url&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;/index.html&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;scope_extensions&amp;quot;: [ 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; {&amp;quot;origin&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://*.example.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;https://*.example.com&amp;quot;}&lt;/a&gt;, {&amp;quot;origin&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://example.co.uk&amp;quot"&gt;https://example.co.uk&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; allows sites that control multiple subdomains and top level domains to be 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; presented as a single web app. Requires listed origins to confirm 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; association with the web app using a .well-known/web-app-origin-association 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; configuration file. { &amp;quot;web_apps&amp;quot; : [ {&amp;quot;web_app_identity&amp;quot;:

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebView application risks 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Goals for experimentationAllow app partners to experiment more broadly 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; with the scope_extensions feature and provide feedback. We want to evaluate 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the shape of the scope_extensions API for ease of use and expose any corner 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cases. Specifically, we want to understand if origin-level granularity is 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sufficient without path filters. We will evaluate this based on feedback 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from OT participants. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ongoing technical constraints 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; None.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Debuggability 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DevTools Application pane will be the appropriate surface to add 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; debugging support. Specifically, a section can be added to help 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; troubleshoot the status of origin association validation. Additionally, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; edge://web-app-internals/ also have relevant information for debugging.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?No 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Supported on Windows, MacOS, Linux, ChromeOS. Not supported on mobile 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; platforms where app identity is implemented differently.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for more context. If a review category is not applicable there is a way to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; mark it as such in the chromestatus review flow for your feature.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You mention 5 reviews, there's Security / Privacy / TAG but I'm not sure
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; what the others are. We believe that the three reviews we know of are not
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; applicable both because this feature doesn't impact them, and because any
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; review would be a rehash of parts of the reviews for the original WebGPU
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; release. Is there a way to mark this in the status entry?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Allows for the use of the half-precision floating-point type f16 in
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebGPU shaders (WGSL). Developers can use the 'shader-f16' feature from 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebGPU spec and the 'f16' extension from the WGSL spec to access 16-bit
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; floating point variables and APIs in their shaders.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; implement f16 in Dawn/Tint, and write proper testing coverage in the CTS.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebView application risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; None at the moment, WebGPU currently does not ship on Android WebView.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Parallel work is occuring to launch WebGPU on Android.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?No
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All platforms will eventually have support. Will immediately be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; available on Mac and Chrome OS, since those are platforms already support
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebGPU. Windows support depends on internal changes to use DXC, which are
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in progress, so f16 will become availabe once that is finished. Linux and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Android are planned to have WebGPU support in the future, so feature will
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; become available when WebGPU does.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and part of the testing of Dawn/Tint in Chromium. Test coverage for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; execution of f16 operations has been implemented,

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; about whether or not explicit enabling of extensions should be required.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Currently it is, so If this changes existing shaders would be fine because
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the desire is to make enabling optional, not removing the mechanism

Hi all,&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

We’re just days away from BlinkOn 18! With one week remaining, there are
just a few housekeeping items to share. If you’re still needing to register
to attend virtually, do so here
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_AVxTu22JbNRDQWEqZ1q4lvzY7Is7FbLy4bGwfziz135Xuw/viewform?usp=sf_link"&gt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_AVxTu22JbNRDQWEqZ1q4lvzY7Is7FbLy4bGwfziz135Xuw/viewform?usp=sf_link&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;.
Virtual registration will be open until the day of the event.

&amp;gt; None
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; SummaryThis intent is for implementing the changes in Blink that are
&amp;gt; necessary to perform a controlled rollout and testing of the planned
&amp;gt; upcoming third-party cookie deprecation, to measure and mitigate ecosystem
&amp;gt; and user impact. As announced before
&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/GJl_aMO6Qt4/m/gFEMFo8FAgAJ"&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/GJl_aMO6Qt4/m/gFEMFo8FAgAJ&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;,
&amp;gt; we will provide two periods of testing (Mode A and Mode B) for sites to
&amp;gt; preview and test the lack of third-party cookies.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Before actually deprecating / removing access to third-party cookies, we
&amp;gt; will send an “Intent to Deprecate and Remove” with additional details to
&amp;gt; satisfy the Blink launch process requirements.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; For more information on Privacy Sandbox for the Web and Google’s plans to
&amp;gt; phase out third-party cookies, see &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://privacysandbox.com/open-web/"&gt;https://privacysandbox.com/open-web/&lt;/a&gt;.

&amp;gt; We will share additional information about the state of interop and compat

&lt;pre&gt;Thank you for the guidance. I commented on each of these, but unfortunately
don't have edit rights on the feature status so I can't mark the reviews as
started.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&amp;gt; Hi Corentin,

&amp;gt; The reviews I'm talking about are the &amp;quot;chips&amp;quot; UI in your chromestatus

&amp;gt; for more context. If a review category is not applicable there is a way to
&amp;gt; mark it as such in the chromestatus review flow for your feature.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; floating point variables and APIs in their shaders.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; None at the moment, WebGPU currently does not ship on Android WebView.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Parallel work is occuring to launch WebGPU on Android.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All platforms will eventually have support. Will immediately be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; available on Mac and Chrome OS, since those are platforms already support
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebGPU. Windows support depends on internal changes to use DXC, which are
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in progress, so f16 will become availabe once that is finished. Linux and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Android are planned to have WebGPU support in the future, so feature will
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; become available when WebGPU does.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Availability expectationFeature is available only in Chromium browsers
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for the near future, on the order of months. Other browsers intend to ship

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anticipated spec changes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; about whether or not explicit enabling of extensions should be required.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Currently it is, so If this changes existing shaders would be fine because
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the desire is to make enabling optional, not removing the mechanism
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; entirely).

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi Yoav,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't know of Gecko's and WebKit's concrete implementation plans for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Intersection Observer Scroll Margin.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; However, based on their responses on the github issue they were
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; supportive.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Just wanted to note that we typically ask for official positions on the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; different vendors standard positions repo.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But given the fact that this is a change Mozilla folks requested and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Apple folks consistently supported on the issue, I think it's fine to not
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; file those in this case.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Regards,

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Intersection Observer scrollMargin allows developers to observe
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; targets inside nested scroll containers that are currently clipped away by
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the scroll containers. This is achieved by expanding the container's
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; clipping rect by the scrollMargin when calculating the intersection.

&lt;pre&gt;This actually triggered a small internal incident at Datadog on a private 
API that wasn't set-up to handle Zstandard encoding properly.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

So two things:

1. Firstly, thanks for bringing this this our attention! We were able to 
patch the error ahead of a more general roll-out to public users.
2. Is there a way we can explicitly opt in to these kinds of A/B tests to 
preemptively catch more of these breaking changes?

This would be particularly useful to our synthetics.

Thanks,
Lee

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Zstandard, or “zstd”, is a data compression mechanism described in 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RFC8878. It is a fast lossless compression algorithm, targeting real-time 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression ratios. The 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;zstd&amp;quot; token was added as an IANA-registered Content-Encoding token as per 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8878#name-content-encoding"&gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8878#name-content-encoding&lt;/a&gt;. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adding support for &amp;quot;zstd&amp;quot; as a Content-Encoding will help load pages faster 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and use less bandwidth.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Risks 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Servers that have a broken implementation of zstd might exist, but the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; risk of this is small. Additionally, middleware and middleboxes like virus 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; checkers that intercept HTTPS connections might not support zstd, but might 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fail to remove it from the Accept-Encoding header in the request.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/775"&gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/775&lt;/a&gt;)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *WebKit*: No signal (
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/168"&gt;https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/168&lt;/a&gt;)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Web developers*: Positive (&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://crbug.com/1246971"&gt;https://crbug.com/1246971&lt;/a&gt;) Facebook (Yann) 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and Akamai (Nic) seem to be positive about zstd content-encoding in the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; browser. Facebook is also excited to test the feature.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Other signals*:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Security 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CRIME and BREACH mean that the resource being compressed can be 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; considered readable by the document deploying them. That is bad if any of 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; them contains information that the document cannot already obtain by other 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; means. An attacker may provide correctly formed compressed frames with 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; unreasonable memory requirements, and dictionaries may interact 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; unexpectedly with a decoder, leading to possible memory or other 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; resource-exhaustion attacks. It is possible to store arbitrary user 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; metadata in skippable frames, so they can be used as a watermark to track 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the path of the compressed payload. It is important to note that these 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; concerns apply to all compression formats, not just zstd.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; To mitigate these risks, similar to Brotli, we'll be advertising support 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for &amp;quot;zstd&amp;quot; encoding only if transferred data is opaque to proxy, to ensure 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that resources don't contain private data that the origin cannot read 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; otherwise.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adding zstd to Chromium adds a large new code surface that processes 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; untrusted data, which inevitably brings risks of new security holes. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; However, this is mitigated by the extensive fuzzing and security analysis 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; done on zstd by Google and other community members.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebView application risks 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Goals for experimentation Understand the impact of supporting zstd 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; content-encoding in the browser on performance and if there's breakage.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ongoing technical constraints 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Debuggability 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No special support needed. Zstd content-encoding support will be exposed 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to the devtools protocol, so developers are able to override it and view 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the headers from the inspector.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)? Yes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests

the reviews have begun the gray chips will turn blue or green. This is a
recent change to chromestatus, see here

for more context. If a review category is not applicable there is a way to
mark it as such in the chromestatus review flow for your feature.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All platforms will eventually have support. Will immediately be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; available on Mac and Chrome OS, since those are platforms already support
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebGPU. Windows support depends on internal changes to use DXC, which are

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Android are planned to have WebGPU support in the future, so feature will

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; about whether or not explicit enabling of extensions should be required.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Currently it is, so If this changes existing shaders would be fine because

&lt;pre&gt;You mention 5 reviews, there's Security / Privacy / TAG but I'm not sure
what the others are. We believe that the three reviews we know of are not
applicable both because this feature doesn't impact them, and because any
review would be a rehash of parts of the reviews for the original WebGPU
release. Is there a way to mark this in the status entry?&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Flag name on chrome://flagsNone
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Finch feature nameWebGPUExposeShader16
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Requires code in //chrome?False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Availability expectationFeature is available only in Chromium browsers
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for the near future, on the order of months. Other browsers intend to ship
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebGPU and f16 support, but don't have specified timelines.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adoption expectationFeature is used by specific partner(s) to provide
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; functionality within 12 months of launch in Chrome.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adoption planMultiple partners are actively developing products/features
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that will use f16 in WebGPU.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Non-OSS dependencies
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Does the feature depend on any code or APIs outside the Chromium open
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; source repository and its open-source dependencies to function?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Estimated milestones
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Shipping on desktop 120
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anticipated spec changes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; None, f16 has been landed in the WebGPU and WGSL specs
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2696"&gt;https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2696&lt;/a&gt; (There is some discussion
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; about whether or not explicit enabling of extensions should be required.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Currently it is, so If this changes existing shaders would be fine because
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the desire is to make enabling optional, not removing the mechanism
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; entirely).

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We plan on landing one change to the Attribution Reporting API focused
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; on:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Multiple cloud providers support for aggregate reporting, supporting
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    AWS and GCP
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       **Note**: This change will also affect Private Aggregation API
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api"&gt;https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;’s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       aggregatable reports by adding a new top-level field
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       aggregation_coordinator_origin.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Explainer changes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Add aggregation coordinator identifier to support multiple cloud
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    providers
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/622"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/622&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Use aggregation coordinator origin instead of identifier
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/829"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/829&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Spec changes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Add aggregation coordinator identifier to aggregatable report
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/728"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/728&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Use aggregation coordinator origin instead of identifier
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/829"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/829&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Add aggregation_coordinator_origin to PAA serialized report
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api/pull/105"&gt;https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api/pull/105&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The change is backwards compatible, and allows developers to select the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deployment option for the aggregation service. By default, the AWS
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; coordinator will be used (the existing behavior), and the public keys will
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; be served on both old and new endpoints during the transition period.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All except Android WebView
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md"&gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Estimated milestones

&lt;pre&gt;Thanks Chris.

I kicked off those reviews in chromestatus, and will ping this thread when
those reviews are complete.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

Thanks,
Nan

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We plan on landing one change to the Attribution Reporting API focused on:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Multiple cloud providers support for aggregate reporting, supporting
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    AWS and GCP
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       **Note**: This change will also affect Private Aggregation API
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api"&gt;https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;’s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       aggregatable reports by adding a new top-level field
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       aggregation_coordinator_origin.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Explainer changes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Add aggregation coordinator identifier to support multiple cloud

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The change is backwards compatible, and allows developers to select the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deployment option for the aggregation service. By default, the AWS
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; coordinator will be used (the existing behavior), and the public keys will
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; be served on both old and new endpoints during the transition period.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All except Android WebView
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests

&lt;pre&gt;LGTM to experiment in 120

&amp;gt; Sorry, forgot to mention the milestone - 120 for running the experiment.
&amp;gt; The code is in place to run the experiment as of 119 but since it hasn't
&amp;gt; run enabled in dev channel and 119 is in Beta now, the plan is to
&amp;gt; experiment in 120.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can you briefly describe what the header parts are good for, and how
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; would developers use them?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There are 2 parts to the header which is formatted as a structured-field
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; dictionary (comma-separated entries with each entry being key=value.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The 2 keys are:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; u (urgency &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-urgency"&gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-urgency&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; = numeric from 0 to 7 with 0 being the highest priority and 7 being the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; lowest (and 3 being the default).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; i (incremental
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-incremental"&gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-incremental&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;) =
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; boolean to specify if the response should be interleaved with other
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; responses of the same priority (defaults to disabled).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; e.g. &amp;quot;priority: u=1, i&amp;quot; would indicate a high priority request that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; allows for interleaving.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm not expecting a lot of direct web developer use of it. It's more for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 servers to use to prioritize multiplexed responses
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and to align with Firefox and Safari for any servers that prefer to just
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; use the headers for prioritization and not do the frame-level priorities
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So this will be sent in both H2 and H3?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (which Chrome is the only browser to use for HTTP/3).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Do you know why other browsers don't implement the frame version?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In theory, a web developer could prioritize the processing of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; higher-priority requests differently than low-priority requests but most
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cases where that makes sense would probably be relying on other headers
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; like &amp;quot;Sec-Purpose: prefetch&amp;quot; if they want to segregate their infrastructure
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and de-prioritize background fetches.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Gecko*: Shipped/Shipping
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *WebKit*: Shipped/Shipping
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Any links that show this is shipping?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I see some evidence that this is available behind a flag in Safari, but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; nothing beyond that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Safari removed the explicit flag in 16.4 for HTTP/3 and enabled it for a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; subset of users but I don't see mention of it in the release notes in 16.4
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; or later so the status hasn't been communicated externally. When HTTP/3
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; does get used in Safari, the Priority header is always enabled. I have a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; test page here (&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://headers.patrickmeenan.com/"&gt;https://headers.patrickmeenan.com/&lt;/a&gt;) that has HTTP/3
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; enabled and will echo the protocol and headers that were received by the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; server. If you can get Safari to use HTTP/3 (at a minimum you have to turn
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; off private relay) then it will show the Priority header.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Firefox pretty reliably switches to HTTP/3 on the test page after a few
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; reloads and will show the header.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The test page also tests what the browser does if fetch() is called with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a priority header that is application-set.  Safari (and the Chrome
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; implementation) defer to the application-set value and do not add the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; protocol-specific value in that case. Firefox sends 2 Priority headers.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Would be great to get an official word from them on what they are
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; shipping and when. Maybe file (non-blocking) positions on this?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md"&gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ?No
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; HTTP headers (and protocols) are not testable in Web Platform Tests.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't think that's correct. You could create custom handlers
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web-platform-tests.org/tools/wptserve/docs/handlers.html#python-handlers"&gt;https://web-platform-tests.org/tools/wptserve/docs/handlers.html#python-handlers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; would reflect the request's priority header in the response.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sorry, headers themselves are testable but this header specifically
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; requires a HTTP/3 server for cross-browser testing (or at least a HTTP/2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; server for Chrome testing) AFAIK, the server in wpt can't test HTTP/3. Even
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; if it could, the actual priority values themselves aren't standardized and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; wouldn't be testable in wpt (other than their presence).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If the header is added to HTTP/1.1 requests (or if at least HTTP/2 is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; supported by the WPT server) then we could use the priority header to test
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fetchpriority and make sure high/low fetchpriority is reflected as a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; relative difference in the priority at the network level but that's not
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; explicitly testing this header (and not currently possible).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As far as TAG review, as Yoav mentioned, this is an IETF spec and Chrome
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is actually catching up to support that has already shipped in other
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; browsers. That said, it might not be a bad idea to get it on the TAG's
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; radar to get some consistency in the fetch() behavior since &amp;quot;Priority&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; isn't currently a reserved header and the browsers differ in how they
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; behave if the header is explicitly set.  Not sure if that's more
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; appropriate for TAG or just for an issue on the fetch spec repository.

&lt;pre&gt;Sorry, forgot to mention the milestone - 120 for running the experiment.
The code is in place to run the experiment as of 119 but since it hasn't
run enabled in dev channel and 119 is in Beta now, the plan is to
experiment in 120.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&amp;gt; on?

&amp;gt; Can you briefly describe what the header parts are good for, and how would
&amp;gt; developers use them?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; There are 2 parts to the header which is formatted as a structured-field
&amp;gt; dictionary (comma-separated entries with each entry being key=value.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; The 2 keys are:
&amp;gt; u (urgency &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-urgency"&gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-urgency&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;)
&amp;gt; = numeric from 0 to 7 with 0 being the highest priority and 7 being the
&amp;gt; lowest (and 3 being the default).
&amp;gt; i (incremental
&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-incremental"&gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-incremental&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;) =
&amp;gt; boolean to specify if the response should be interleaved with other
&amp;gt; responses of the same priority (defaults to disabled).
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; e.g. &amp;quot;priority: u=1, i&amp;quot; would indicate a high priority request that allows
&amp;gt; for interleaving.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; I'm not expecting a lot of direct web developer use of it. It's more for
&amp;gt; the HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 servers to use to prioritize multiplexed responses
&amp;gt; and to align with Firefox and Safari for any servers that prefer to just
&amp;gt; use the headers for prioritization and not do the frame-level priorities
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; So this will be sent in both H2 and H3?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; (which Chrome is the only browser to use for HTTP/3).
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Do you know why other browsers don't implement the frame version?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; In theory, a web developer could prioritize the processing of
&amp;gt; higher-priority requests differently than low-priority requests but most
&amp;gt; cases where that makes sense would probably be relying on other headers
&amp;gt; like &amp;quot;Sec-Purpose: prefetch&amp;quot; if they want to segregate their infrastructure
&amp;gt; and de-prioritize background fetches.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; *Gecko*: Shipped/Shipping
&amp;gt; *WebKit*: Shipped/Shipping
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Any links that show this is shipping?
&amp;gt; I see some evidence that this is available behind a flag in Safari, but
&amp;gt; nothing beyond that.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Safari removed the explicit flag in 16.4 for HTTP/3 and enabled it for a
&amp;gt; subset of users but I don't see mention of it in the release notes in 16.4
&amp;gt; or later so the status hasn't been communicated externally. When HTTP/3
&amp;gt; does get used in Safari, the Priority header is always enabled. I have a
&amp;gt; test page here (&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://headers.patrickmeenan.com/"&gt;https://headers.patrickmeenan.com/&lt;/a&gt;) that has HTTP/3
&amp;gt; enabled and will echo the protocol and headers that were received by the
&amp;gt; server. If you can get Safari to use HTTP/3 (at a minimum you have to turn
&amp;gt; off private relay) then it will show the Priority header.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Firefox pretty reliably switches to HTTP/3 on the test page after a few
&amp;gt; reloads and will show the header.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; The test page also tests what the browser does if fetch() is called with a
&amp;gt; priority header that is application-set.  Safari (and the Chrome
&amp;gt; implementation) defer to the application-set value and do not add the
&amp;gt; protocol-specific value in that case. Firefox sends 2 Priority headers.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Would be great to get an official word from them on what they are shipping
&amp;gt; and when. Maybe file (non-blocking) positions on this?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests
&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md"&gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; ?No
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; HTTP headers (and protocols) are not testable in Web Platform Tests.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; I don't think that's correct. You could create custom handlers
&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web-platform-tests.org/tools/wptserve/docs/handlers.html#python-handlers"&gt;https://web-platform-tests.org/tools/wptserve/docs/handlers.html#python-handlers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;  that
&amp;gt; would reflect the request's priority header in the response.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Sorry, headers themselves are testable but this header specifically
&amp;gt; requires a HTTP/3 server for cross-browser testing (or at least a HTTP/2
&amp;gt; server for Chrome testing) AFAIK, the server in wpt can't test HTTP/3. Even
&amp;gt; if it could, the actual priority values themselves aren't standardized and
&amp;gt; wouldn't be testable in wpt (other than their presence).
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; If the header is added to HTTP/1.1 requests (or if at least HTTP/2 is
&amp;gt; supported by the WPT server) then we could use the priority header to test
&amp;gt; fetchpriority and make sure high/low fetchpriority is reflected as a
&amp;gt; relative difference in the priority at the network level but that's not
&amp;gt; explicitly testing this header (and not currently possible).
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; As far as TAG review, as Yoav mentioned, this is an IETF spec and Chrome
&amp;gt; is actually catching up to support that has already shipped in other
&amp;gt; browsers. That said, it might not be a bad idea to get it on the TAG's
&amp;gt; radar to get some consistency in the fetch() behavior since &amp;quot;Priority&amp;quot;
&amp;gt; isn't currently a reserved header and the browsers differ in how they
&amp;gt; behave if the header is explicitly set.  Not sure if that's more
&amp;gt; appropriate for TAG or just for an issue on the fetch spec repository.
&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi Yoav,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't know of Gecko's and WebKit's concrete implementation plans for
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Intersection Observer Scroll Margin.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; However, based on their responses on the github issue they were
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; supportive.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Just wanted to note that we typically ask for official positions on the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; different vendors standard positions repo.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But given the fact that this is a change Mozilla folks requested and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Apple folks consistently supported on the issue, I think it's fine to not
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; file those in this case.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Intersection Observer scrollMargin allows developers to observe targets
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; inside nested scroll containers that are currently clipped away by the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; scroll containers. This is achieved by expanding the container's clipping
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rect by the scrollMargin when calculating the intersection.

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; So this will be sent in both H2 and H3?
&amp;gt;

Yes. As it stands right now, the Priority header will be sent in all cases
where we prioritize (and already send frame-level priorities) on
multiplexed connections (HTTP/2 and HTTP/3).  The benefit of sending it on
HTTP/2 is that it will let any endpoints that are not supporting the HTTP/2
dependency tree to start implementing support for at least initial
priorities if they are interested in doing it (and for CDN's like
Cloudflare that apply the extensible priorities-type scheme to HTTP/2
already to use explicit params instead of translating the browser-specific
trees and weights from HTTP/2 into equivalent priorities).  Eventually it
would be worth experimenting with HTTP/2 priority update frames so sites
that DO already support prioritization could switch completely over but
that's out of scope for this particular change.


&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; (which Chrome is the only browser to use for HTTP/3).
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Do you know why other browsers don't implement the frame version?
&amp;gt;

The frame version is mostly in place to support reprioritizing in-flight
requests (though it technically supports being used for an initial priority
which is what Chrome does since Chrome also supports reprioritization). I'm
not sure why other browsers decided to use the headers rather than the
frames but there are a lot of possibilities where it makes sense (if the
headers are easier to add, if the layering is such that QUIC is done in the
OS-layer and priorities are done by the browser).


&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Would be great to get an official word from them on what they are shipping
&amp;gt; and when. Maybe file (non-blocking) positions on this?
&amp;gt;

Position for extensible priorities specifically or HTTP/3? Has Safari ever
committed publicly to timelines? Position appears to be more than
supportive since it's been implemented since Safari 14 or 15, the feature
flag removed in 16.4 and it's mostly just questions around the rollout.
There's some level of interaction with their IP-blinding proxy work that
make it a bit more complicated.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Intersection Observer scrollMargin allows developers to observe targets 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; inside nested scroll containers that are currently clipped away by the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; scroll containers. This is achieved by expanding the container's clipping 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rect by the scrollMargin when calculating the intersection.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Intersection Observer scrollMargin allows developers to observe targets 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; inside nested scroll containers that are currently clipped away by the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; scroll containers. This is achieved by expanding the container's clipping 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rect by the scrollMargin when calculating the intersection.

Hi,

While Alex's concerns are totally valid to consider from a feature design 
perspective, I think they are better to be discussed on the WHATWG issues 
for this feature. I chatted offline with Alex and he agreed about that 
point, and agreed to post comments and questions there.

So from an API owners perspective LGTM1 modulo considering and taking into 
account all comments and feedback from Alex on the spec (as we should for 
all such feedback from anyone, of course!).

I don't understand why you find this strange, or a footgun. It's intended 
to be the opposite: it guides developers toward creating the experience the 
user expects, where when the user requests to close something, the last 
thing that was opened, is what closes.


Chris Palmer covered this pretty well recently, so I'll defer to his more 
eloquent writeup:

&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://noncombatant.org/2023/05/29/complexities-of-allocation/"&gt;https://noncombatant.org/2023/05/29/complexities-of-allocation/&lt;/a&gt;

Basically, this is spooky action at a distance and without _at least_ some 
reflection and manipulation surface (via DOM, probably), it's hard to 
understand how this won't turn into a footgun.

As a separate note, I'm disappointed in the proliferation of APIs that 
affect DOM but have no API and reflection. Import Maps spring to mind, but 
there are other recent examples too. If manual disposal is going to be 
required for this, we should at least make it possible to introspect 
outside the scope in which an object that defines this behaviour is 
allocated.


In what way does this API affect the DOM? No parts of the DOM tree are 
modified by CloseWatcher. The same is true for import maps...


This is view state, which is frequently reflected via DOM. The primary 
concern here is that there's no way to inspect and/or modify the stack 
(attached to Node instances or not) independently of closure-scoped object 
lifetimes.


It's not clear to me what definition of &amp;quot;view state&amp;quot; you are using, such 
that it encompasses things like the module specifier resolution algorithm 
or the routing of Android back gestures.

Maybe, if this is a principle you believe in, you could file it as a 
suggestion on the w3ctag/design-principles repository, ideally with a clear 
explanation of what the boundaries of this &amp;quot;view state&amp;quot; concept are. 
(Including what, in your view, would *not* quality as view state.)

 

The TAG feedback didn't touch on this very much, AFAICT, but it's somewhat 
surprising that the stack of close actions isn't inspectable.


I can't speak for the TAG, but here are the reasons why the stack of close 
watchers isn't inspectable:

   - We received no developer or partner feedback requesting this capability
   - This could cause potential forward-compat problems without careful 
   design. E.g., it could make it possible for developers to write code that 
   assumes that only CloseWatchers, dialogs, and popover=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; elements are close 
   watchers, and thus make it hard for the web platform to introduce a fourth 
   close watcher (e.g., &amp;lt;selectlist&amp;gt;) in the future.
   - This would be somewhat of an encapsulation leak between different 
   parts of the application, making it harder to write resilient components. 
   (This is not a strong argument, but rather a bias toward waiting for a use 
   case instead of just exposing the information automatically.)

Thanks, I appreciate the context, and I am impressed by the thoroughness of 
the design artifacts.
 

What's the behaviour of non-`destroy()`'d watchers; e.g. if a developer 
forgets to dispose of one correctly? Can users get stuck?


Non-destroy()ed is the default state of a CloseWatcher, so such 
CloseWatchers will respond to the next close request if they are on the top 
of the stack. The user cannot really get stuck, as every close request will 
either destroy the topmost close watcher on the stack, or possibly trigger 
(at most once) a preventDefault()ed cancel event. See 
&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher/blob/main/README.md#abuse-analysis"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher/blob/main/README.md#abuse-analysis&lt;/a&gt; 
for more details.


Also helpful; thank you!
 

Note that the API generally guides you away from this possibility by making 
the simpler code be the one that automatically calls destroy() for you:

Summary

&amp;quot;Close requests&amp;quot; are a new concept that encompasses user requests to close 
something currently open, using the Esc key on desktop or the back 
gesture/button on Android. Integrating them into Chromium comes with two 
changes: * CloseWatcher, a new API for directly listening and responding to 
close requests. * Upgrades to &amp;lt;dialog&amp;gt; and popover=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; to use the new close 
request framework, so that they respond to the Android back button.

Risks


Interoperability and Compatibility

This API is designed to have an interoperable surface for web developers, 
to help them avoid platform-specific code. So, if it were implemented 
across browsers, it would be a positive for interoperability. Otherwise, it 
has the usual risks of not getting adopted by other vendors. Compatibility: 
To avoid allowing CloseWatchers, dialogs, and popovers (&amp;quot;close watchers&amp;quot;) 
to prevent the Android back gesture/button from navigating through history, 
how close watchers respond to close requests depends on user activation. If 
no user activation occurs between opening, and the user issuing a close 
request, this can cause a CloseWatcher/dialog's cancel event to be skipped, 
or cause multiple close watchers to be closed at once. Although this 
behavior is meant to prevent back-trapping on Android specifically, it 
applies to desktop as well, for interoperability reasons. This change is a 
compatibility risk. However, use counters show it to be an acceptable one: 
- 0.000015% of pages impacted by skipped cancel events - 0.000007% of pages 
impacted by skipped cancel events that would otherwise call 
preventDefault() - between 0.000000% and 0.000001% of pages impacted by 
multiple dialogs closed

*Other signals*:

Activation

The CloseWatcher API is meant to be usable as a progressive enhancement; if 
developers use it with feature detection, then their app will be able to 
watch for unusual close watchers in supporting browsers, while falling back 
to listening for the Esc key in browsers that haven't implemented the API. 
It would benefit from a conditional polyfill that translates the Esc key 
into a close signal, so that then developers don't even have to have 
feature detection and fallback logic, but can just use the CloseWatcher API 
surface. One such polyfill is available in the demo: 
&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://close-watcher-demo.glitch.me/"&gt;https://close-watcher-demo.glitch.me/&lt;/a&gt;


Security

The main security-related concern in this API is preventing it from being 
usable for back-trapping, i.e. disabling the Android back gesture/button. 
Although this is already possible in Chromium and other browsers due to 
bugs, we worked to ensure CloseWatcher and close request integration to 
dialogs/popups does not increase the size of the problem, by gating 
repeated use of these behind transient user activation checks: see 
&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher#abuse-analysis"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/close-watcher#abuse-analysis&lt;/a&gt;


WebView application risks

Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that 
it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?

Beyond the low risks already listed in the Compat section, we do not 
anticipate any WebView-specific risks. A base::Feature killswitch is 
available just in case.


Debuggability

No special DevTools support is required.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Explainer:*
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is a small addition to the MediaStreamTrack
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/mediacapture-main/master/getusermedia.html#dom-mediastreamtrack"&gt;https://rawgit.com/w3c/mediacapture-main/master/getusermedia.html#dom-mediastreamtrack&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The new `track.stats` attribute getter allows a JS app to obtain statistics
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; of a track, which in the case of video refers to frame counters. For
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; example, if you use getUserMedia() to open a camera at a specific frame
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rate setting, this API lets you know how many frames the camera is actually
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; producing (e.g. frame rate may be lower in low light conditions or higher
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; than the app wants due to HW capabilities) and how many frames, if any, are
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; discarded or dropped by the user agent, which is useful for investigations
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and experiments (some concrete examples mentioned here
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/895"&gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/895&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Spec:*
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-extensions/#mediastreamtrack-statistics"&gt;https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-extensions/#mediastreamtrack-statistics&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is an extension spec, owned by the same working group who owns the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; main spec.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The spec and implementation currently only covers video frames, but
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; similar audio frame counters are being considered for the future as well.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Summary:*
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Add frame counters to MediaStreamTrack.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Is this feature supported on all six Blink platforms?*
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Measurements*
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will add [Measure].
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; *Risks*
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Compatibility: MediaStreamTrack is supported on all browsers and the new
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; stats API is a read-only statistics API rather than core functionality, so
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; interop risks should be relatively limited.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Signals from other implementers:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Firefox: positive (request for position
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/895"&gt;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/895&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - Safari: no signal at the time of writing (request for position

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ergonomics: Used together with MediaStreamTrack and WebRTC

        At this morning's API Owners meeting, they asked me to add
        all review gate types to all of the &amp;quot;web developer facing
        code change&amp;quot; features that are currently under review,
        including this one. So, I have added Privacy, Security,
        Enterprise, Debuggability, and Testing gates to your feature
        entry.

        Please click the gate chips in the &amp;quot;Prepare to ship&amp;quot; stage on
        your feature detail page.  For each one, answer survey
        questions and request that cross-functional review.  You can
        request them all in parallel.  In cases where you already
        have the go/launch &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://goto.google.com/launch"&gt;https://goto.google.com/launch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; bit
        approved, you can note that in a comment on that gate for a

                        Summary

                We plan to ship the following changes to the Shared
                Storage API:

                1.

                    Only allow Private Aggregation reports for up to
                    5 seconds after a worklet operation starts

                    1.

                        This is a privacy measure to prevent timing
                        attacks.

                    2.

                        Reports sent after this point are silently
                        dropped

                2.

                    Allow writing to and deleting from Shared Storage
                    via HTTP response header

                    1.

                        This is a performance improvement and is
                        backwards compatible

                3.

                    Per-site privacy budgeting

                    1.

                        This change enforces budgets to per-site
                        rather than per-origin

                        Risks


                        Interoperability and Compatibility

                Change [1] will drop the private aggregation
                contributions issued after 5 seconds after a worklet
                operation starts. 5 seconds should be sufficient for
                all known use cases, so this change should have
                negligible backward compatibility issues.

                Change [2] is optional and fully backwards compatible.

                Change [3] could decrease budget for those that are
                using multiple origins today that are considered part
                of the same eTLD+1. Since the API is new (shipped in
                M115), the expectation is for the impact to be low.
                It will not break script since the APIs gracefully
                handle situations where the budget is exceeded, but
                could impact the overall quality of the returned data
                for that site.

                        WebView application risks

                Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of
                existing APIs, such that it has potentially high risk
                for Android WebView-based applications?

                None



                        Debuggability

                Shared Storage database contents for an origin can be
                viewed and modified within devtools. Support for
                debugging Shared Storage worklets will be available
                within the next couple of milestones.



                        Will this feature be supported on all six
                        Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome

&lt;pre&gt;One last question: what milestones are you planning to run this experiment 
on?&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

Can you briefly describe what the header parts are good for, and how would 
developers use them?


There are 2 parts to the header which is formatted as a structured-field 
dictionary (comma-separated entries with each entry being key=value.

The 2 keys are:
u (urgency &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-urgency"&gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-urgency&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;) = 
numeric from 0 to 7 with 0 being the highest priority and 7 being the 
lowest (and 3 being the default).
i (incremental 
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-incremental"&gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9218#name-incremental&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;) = boolean 
to specify if the response should be interleaved with other responses of 
the same priority (defaults to disabled).

e.g. &amp;quot;priority: u=1, i&amp;quot; would indicate a high priority request that allows 
for interleaving.

I'm not expecting a lot of direct web developer use of it. It's more for 
the HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 servers to use to prioritize multiplexed responses 
and to align with Firefox and Safari for any servers that prefer to just 
use the headers for prioritization and not do the frame-level priorities 

So this will be sent in both H2 and H3?
 

(which Chrome is the only browser to use for HTTP/3).


Do you know why other browsers don't implement the frame version?
 


In theory, a web developer could prioritize the processing of 
higher-priority requests differently than low-priority requests but most 
cases where that makes sense would probably be relying on other headers 
like &amp;quot;Sec-Purpose: prefetch&amp;quot; if they want to segregate their infrastructure 
and de-prioritize background fetches.
 

 


*Gecko*: Shipped/Shipping
*WebKit*: Shipped/Shipping


Any links that show this is shipping?
I see some evidence that this is available behind a flag in Safari, but 
nothing beyond that.


Safari removed the explicit flag in 16.4 for HTTP/3 and enabled it for a 
subset of users but I don't see mention of it in the release notes in 16.4 
or later so the status hasn't been communicated externally. When HTTP/3 
does get used in Safari, the Priority header is always enabled. I have a 
test page here (&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://headers.patrickmeenan.com/"&gt;https://headers.patrickmeenan.com/&lt;/a&gt;) that has HTTP/3 enabled 
and will echo the protocol and headers that were received by the server. If 
you can get Safari to use HTTP/3 (at a minimum you have to turn off private 
relay) then it will show the Priority header.

Firefox pretty reliably switches to HTTP/3 on the test page after a few 
reloads and will show the header.

The test page also tests what the browser does if fetch() is called with a 
priority header that is application-set.  Safari (and the Chrome 
implementation) defer to the application-set value and do not add the 
protocol-specific value in that case. Firefox sends 2 Priority headers.


Would be great to get an official word from them on what they are shipping 
and when. Maybe file (non-blocking) positions on this? 

 

 


Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests 
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md"&gt;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
?No

HTTP headers (and protocols) are not testable in Web Platform Tests.


I don't think that's correct. You could create custom handlers 
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://web-platform-tests.org/tools/wptserve/docs/handlers.html#python-handlers"&gt;https://web-platform-tests.org/tools/wptserve/docs/handlers.html#python-handlers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
 that 
would reflect the request's priority header in the response.


Sorry, headers themselves are testable but this header specifically 
requires a HTTP/3 server for cross-browser testing (or at least a HTTP/2 
server for Chrome testing) AFAIK, the server in wpt can't test HTTP/3. Even 
if it could, the actual priority values themselves aren't standardized and 
wouldn't be testable in wpt (other than their presence).

If the header is added to HTTP/1.1 requests (or if at least HTTP/2 is 
supported by the WPT server) then we could use the priority header to test 
fetchpriority and make sure high/low fetchpriority is reflected as a 
relative difference in the priority at the network level but that's not 
explicitly testing this header (and not currently possible).
 

  



As far as TAG review, as Yoav mentioned, this is an IETF spec and Chrome is 
actually catching up to support that has already shipped in other browsers. 
That said, it might not be a bad idea to get it on the TAG's radar to get 
some consistency in the fetch() behavior since &amp;quot;Priority&amp;quot; isn't currently a 
reserved header and the browsers differ in how they behave if the header is 
explicitly set.  Not sure if that's more appropriate for TAG or just for an 
issue on the fetch spec repository.

I don't see the other review categories (security, privacy, etc) in the
Prepare to Ship stage in chromestatus.
How shall I edit and request review for those? Thanks.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

Best,
Nan

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The change is backwards compatible, and allows developers to select the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deployment option for the aggregation service. By default, the AWS
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; coordinator will be used (the existing behavior), and the public keys will
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; be served on both old and new endpoints during the transition period.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All except Android WebView

&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Adds a &amp;quot;scope_extensions&amp;quot; app manifest member that enables web apps to
&amp;gt; extend their scope to other origins. Example usage: { &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Example&amp;quot;,
&amp;gt; &amp;quot;display&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;standalone&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;start_url&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;/index.html&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;scope_extensions&amp;quot;: [
&amp;gt; {&amp;quot;origin&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://*.example.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;https://*.example.com&amp;quot;}&lt;/a&gt;, {&amp;quot;origin&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://example.co.uk&amp;quot"&gt;https://example.co.uk&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;;
&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://example.co.uk"&gt;https://example.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;}, {&amp;quot;origin&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://*.example.co.uk&amp;quot;}"&gt;https://*.example.co.uk&amp;quot;}&lt;/a&gt; ] } This
&amp;gt; allows sites that control multiple subdomains and top level domains to be
&amp;gt; presented as a single web app. Requires listed origins to confirm
&amp;gt; association with the web app using a .well-known/web-app-origin-association
&amp;gt; configuration file. { &amp;quot;web_apps&amp;quot; : [ {&amp;quot;web_app_identity&amp;quot;:

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; WebView application risks
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
&amp;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Goals for experimentationAllow app partners to experiment more broadly
&amp;gt; with the scope_extensions feature and provide feedback. We want to evaluate
&amp;gt; the shape of the scope_extensions API for ease of use and expose any corner
&amp;gt; cases. Specifically, we want to understand if origin-level granularity is
&amp;gt; sufficient without path filters. We will evaluate this based on feedback
&amp;gt; from OT participants.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Ongoing technical constraints
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; None.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Debuggability
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; DevTools Application pane will be the appropriate surface to add debugging
&amp;gt; support. Specifically, a section can be added to help troubleshoot the
&amp;gt; status of origin association validation. Additionally,
&amp;gt; edge://web-app-internals/ also have relevant information for debugging.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&amp;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?No
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Supported on Windows, MacOS, Linux, ChromeOS. Not supported on mobile
&amp;gt; platforms where app identity is implemented differently.

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; We plan on landing one change to the Attribution Reporting API focused on:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;    Multiple cloud providers support for aggregate reporting, supporting
&amp;gt;    AWS and GCP
&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;       **Note**: This change will also affect Private Aggregation API
&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api"&gt;https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;’s
&amp;gt;       aggregatable reports by adding a new top-level field
&amp;gt;       aggregation_coordinator_origin.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Explainer changes
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;    -
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;    Add aggregation coordinator identifier to support multiple cloud
&amp;gt;    providers &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/622"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/622&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; The change is backwards compatible, and allows developers to select the
&amp;gt; deployment option for the aggregation service. By default, the AWS
&amp;gt; coordinator will be used (the existing behavior), and the public keys will
&amp;gt; be served on both old and new endpoints during the transition period.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&amp;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; All except Android WebView
&amp;gt;

&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Allows for the use of the half-precision floating-point type f16 in WebGPU
&amp;gt; shaders (WGSL). Developers can use the 'shader-f16' feature from the WebGPU
&amp;gt; spec and the 'f16' extension from the WGSL spec to access 16-bit floating
&amp;gt; point variables and APIs in their shaders.

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; *Web developers*: Positive f16 support in general has been requested
&amp;gt; feature in multiple different web runtimes/frameworks, e.g.
&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/9758"&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/9758&lt;/a&gt; and

&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/658"&gt;https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/658&lt;/a&gt;, there were multiple
&amp;gt; benchmarks/demoes that indicate a substantial performance benefit shown in
&amp;gt; demos/tests, ~25% if ALU bound, and upto 50% if memory bound. TF.js has
&amp;gt; been investigating using f16 in WebGPU,

&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/1047"&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/1047&lt;/a&gt; The Dawn team has
&amp;gt; interacted with multiple internal and external partners that have indicated
&amp;gt; that f16 support is an important feature for them to get the performance
&amp;gt; needed to adopt WebGPU
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; *Other signals*: Intel has dedicated significant resources to help
&amp;gt; implement f16 in Dawn/Tint, and write proper testing coverage in the CTS.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; WebView application risks
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such that
&amp;gt; it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; None at the moment, WebGPU currently does not ship on Android WebView.
&amp;gt; Parallel work is occuring to launch WebGPU on Android.

&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows, Mac,
&amp;gt; Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?No
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; All platforms will eventually have support. Will immediately be available
&amp;gt; on Mac and Chrome OS, since those are platforms already support WebGPU.
&amp;gt; Windows support depends on internal changes to use DXC, which are in
&amp;gt; progress, so f16 will become availabe once that is finished. Linux and
&amp;gt; Android are planned to have WebGPU support in the future, so feature will
&amp;gt; become available when WebGPU does.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This feature adds the ability to construct exclusive accordions using a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sequence of HTML &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements. It adds a name attribute to the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; element. When this attribute is used, multiple &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that have the same name form a group. At most one element in the group can
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; be open at once.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This looks great!!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The only tiny concern I have is the question of compatibility: Is it
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; possible that existing &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements share a name attribute?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Would it be possible for you to run a quick HTTPArchive scan and see
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this is not a semi-common pattern?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I ran a query with HTTPArchive
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpjWFoXBiuFYI4zb9I7wHs7uYZ0ntbOgLwH-mgqXdEM/edit"&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpjWFoXBiuFYI4zb9I7wHs7uYZ0ntbOgLwH-mgqXdEM/edit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in particular, the following query:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SELECT page, url
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FROM `httparchive.all.requests`
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHERE
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; date = '2023-09-01' AND
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; client = 'desktop' AND
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is_main_document AND
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; REGEXP_CONTAINS(response_body, r
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; '(?is)&amp;lt;details[[:space:]][^&amp;gt;]*?[[:space:]]name(=|[[:space:]]|&amp;gt;)')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This produced 6 urls (for 7 pages; two of them redirect to the same
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; URL).  I did view-source: of the 6 urls and based on visual inspection
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; found that 0 of the 6 would be broken by shipping this feature.  In more
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; detail:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    - 3 of the 6 (associated with the same site, mailchimp.com) had
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    multiple &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements, on each of which the name and id attributes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    had the same value, and these values were properly unique (at least among
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    the &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    - 1 had a single &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; with name=&amp;quot;somename&amp;quot;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    - 1 had a single &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; with name=&amp;quot;body&amp;quot; and id=&amp;quot;body&amp;quot;; there were
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    other elements with this name/id, but none of the others were &amp;lt;details&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    - 1 had a single &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; element with a unique-ish looking name
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So none of the pages found used the name attribute in a way that would be
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; affected by shipping this feature (i.e., multiple &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the same name).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anticipated spec changes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Open questions about a feature may be a source of future web compat or
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; interop issues. Please list open issues (e.g. links to known github issues
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the project for the feature specification) whose resolution may
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; introduce web compat/interop risk (e.g., changing to naming or structure of
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the API in a non-backward-compatible way).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There may still be some small changes as part of the process of getting
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9400"&gt;https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9400&lt;/a&gt; finished, but I hope to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; implement those before shipping (at least those that happen soon).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The PR is merged. Is there more work happening on it?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.  I sent the intent before the PR was merged.  I do still need to
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; follow up on a piece of the discussion there and file an issue on html-aam,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; though.

&lt;pre&gt;I don't normally weigh in on these but I just wanted to say that I think 
this one is pretty unique for a whole bunch of reasons and it's not just an 
example of bikeshedding after shipping by a specific vendor or something.  
It's more than that.  As much as I think this is important, and wanted it, 
there were a million other things to talk about re: custom elements that 
were ahead of it and it just didn't get the level of oxygen that it needed 
from many quarters, it seems to me, in order to surface the right 
thoughts.  As it's picked up, over the last few years there were 
disagreements, counterpoints, etc at many stages through WHATWG, TAG, 
CSSWG... It feels like it would be good to summarize all of it somewhere - 
and I'm not even saying the decision here is &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; or something ... I'm 
just saying that I don't think it is as simple as &amp;quot;bikeshedding after 
shipping&amp;quot; implies&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&amp;gt; gray-area situation and no progress is made.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; I don't think that 0.03% is a big problem to deprecate, and recommend we 
&amp;gt; just make the change to match a hard-won consensus and move on. It's easy 
&amp;gt; enough to support both syntaxes for some amount of time before removing the 
&amp;gt; old one.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and the suggestion was that if a CSS spec for a feature is &amp;quot;unstable&amp;quot; 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (meaning 'not at CR'?), then we should either post &amp;quot;we're about to send an 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; intent&amp;quot; to the last issue discussing it, or file an &amp;quot;Is X ready to ship?&amp;quot; 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; issue. I think +Chris Harrelson is likely to have the strongest 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; opinions about this: should we add such a rule to our launch process for 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CSS features?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think we generally shouldn't ship CSS features before there is robust 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; discussion and consensus at the CSSWG, and I think Chromium features have 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; done a good job at that. The CSSWG resolution mechanism, and the various 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; stages of W3C standardization help to build confidence about the degree of 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; consensus and commitment, as do signals from other browser vendors. I don't 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; think we should additionally require filing an &amp;quot;is X ready to ship?&amp;quot; issue 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; at the CSSWG for CSS features.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; then having the CSSWG ask us to change it to :state(foo) instead, and 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; what

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think if this was specced before shipping that would have been 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; better and is a practice that I (and we?) currently follow, but this was 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; shipped a number of years ago.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, good point: it's totally possible that our more recent process 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rigor is sufficient, and we don't need anything new to prevent this in the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; future. No matter what, we should expect the occasional old feature to pop 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; up and be an exception.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do think that it's worth finding a way to write down your current 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; practice, so that it doesn't regress if you switch teams. I think you mean 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that you do &amp;quot;hold off on shipping CSS features until they land in an 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; official draft&amp;quot;, so let's try to record that if it's our idea of the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; solution.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; says we can expect after Chrome has shipped a feature.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This was my bad, I didn't realize or didn't completely consider 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; usecounters before I presented the name change to the CSSWG.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I am hoping that with an answer from the API owners, I can go back to 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the CSSWG and potentially change it back.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There is still no merged spec in HTML or CSS for this feature yet, but 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I have open PRs in both specs.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It looks like the initial proposal was :state(foo); the CSSWG asked 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to change it to :--foo in 2020

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; about this isn't as committed as it appears to an external observer?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Should we generally hold off on shipping CSS features until they land 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in an official draft, or even in a CR? Should we be clearer to the CSSWG 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; when we decide to ship ahead of their consensus that the bar for changes 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; is 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; going up? There's not good support for this kind of per-WG restriction 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chrome Status yet, but maybe it'll fit near

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hrm, this is another instance of bikeshedding after shipping, and 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm not inclined to approve. Perhaps we can discuss at next week's API 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OWNERs meeting?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The spec for the new syntax hasn't been merged yet, I haven't 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; finished implementing it in chromium yet, and I don't have estimated 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; milestones yet, but I'd like to get the API owners thoughts on whether 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; this 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; deprecation would be acceptable to help guide the spec discussion.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I did some analysis of the top 8 websites on the chromestatus entry 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to see what the breakage would be like: 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BHoO12ts0E-NQQH9AMwR2sKAIV0OPB-FA_8QXMpolz0/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BHoO12ts0E-NQQH9AMwR2sKAIV0OPB-FA_8QXMpolz0/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I found that most of them had the affected custom elements behind 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; display:none rules that I had to manually remove in order to use them. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There was only one website where there was actual breakage by default, 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; which case the carousel buttons didn't work on firefox and safari. If 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; new syntax is just for the CSS property and we keep CustomStateSet the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; same, then the affected website's buttons would continue to work but 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; whatever custom styles they have (which I couldn't trigger) wouldn't 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; apply 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; anymore.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Personally, I think that this breakage would not be bad especially 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; if we keep CustomStateSet the same, and I kind of like :state(foo) 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; more 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; than :--foo. However, I might have not made it clear in the spec 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; discussions yet that we have already shipped :--foo by default for 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; several 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; years.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CSS custom state, which allows custom elements to expose their own 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; pseudo-classes, was shipped here:

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This feature has not been implemented in gecko or webkit yet. I 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; recently made an effort to spec this feature in CSSWG and WHATWG, but 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; there 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; was pushback to change the syntax back from :--foo to :state(foo), 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and the 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CSSWG has resolved to do this as well:

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; syntax and the new syntax so websites can switch to the new one.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks Jason!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And yes, Cammie (and team), please request approval bits in Chromestatus
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; - API OWNERs will wait on that (not approvals, just beginning the process
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for each) before approving.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; thanks,

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; At this morning's API Owners meeting, they asked me to add all review
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; gate types to all of the &amp;quot;web developer facing code change&amp;quot; features that
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; are currently under review, including this one.  So, I have added Privacy,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Security, Enterprise, Debuggability, and Testing gates to your feature
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; entry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Please click the gate chips in the &amp;quot;Prepare to ship&amp;quot; stage on your
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; feature detail page.  For each one, answer survey questions and request
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that cross-functional review.  You can request them all in parallel.  In
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cases where you already have the go/launch
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://goto.google.com/launch"&gt;https://goto.google.com/launch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; bit approved, you can note that in a

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Summary
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We plan to ship the following changes to the Shared Storage API:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    1.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Only allow Private Aggregation reports for up to 5 seconds after a
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    worklet operation starts
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    1.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       This is a privacy measure to prevent timing attacks.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       2.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       Reports sent after this point are silently dropped
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       2.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Allow writing to and deleting from Shared Storage via HTTP response
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    header
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    1.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       This is a performance improvement and is backwards compatible
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       3.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Per-site privacy budgeting
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    1.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       This change enforces budgets to per-site rather than per-origin
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Blink component
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Blink&amp;gt;Storage&amp;gt;SharedStorage
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=component%3ABlink%3EStorage%3ESharedStorage&amp;can=2"&gt;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=component%3ABlink%3EStorage%3ESharedStorage&amp;can=2&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Interoperability and Compatibility
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Change [1] will drop the private aggregation contributions issued after
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5 seconds after a worklet operation starts. 5 seconds should be sufficient
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for all known use cases, so this change should have negligible backward
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; compatibility issues.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Change [2] is optional and fully backwards compatible.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Change [3] could decrease budget for those that are using multiple
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; origins today that are considered part of the same eTLD+1. Since the API is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; new (shipped in M115), the expectation is for the impact to be low. It will
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; not break script since the APIs gracefully handle situations where the
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; budget is exceeded, but could impact the overall quality of the returned
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; data for that site.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gecko: No signal
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebKit: No signal
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Web developers: No signals
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Other signals:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WebView application risks
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Does this intent deprecate or change behavior of existing APIs, such
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that it has potentially high risk for Android WebView-based applications?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; None
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Debuggability
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Shared Storage database contents for an origin can be viewed and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; modified within devtools. Support for debugging Shared Storage worklets
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; will be available within the next couple of milestones.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Will this feature be supported on all six Blink platforms (Windows,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Android WebView)?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All but WebView
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anticipated spec changes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    1.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    2.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;    Allow writing to Shared Storage via response headers

                    Summary


                    This feature adds the ability to construct
                    exclusive accordions using a sequence of HTML
                    &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements. It adds a name attribute to
                    the &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; element. When this attribute is
                    used, multiple &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements that have the
                    same name form a group. At most one element in the
                    group can be open at once.


        This looks great!!
        The only tiny concern I have is the question of compatibility:
        Is it possible that existing &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements share a name
        attribute?
        Would it be possible for you to run a quick HTTPArchive scan
        and see this is not a semi-common pattern?


    I ran a query with HTTPArchive
    
&amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpjWFoXBiuFYI4zb9I7wHs7uYZ0ntbOgLwH-mgqXdEM/edit"&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpjWFoXBiuFYI4zb9I7wHs7uYZ0ntbOgLwH-mgqXdEM/edit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;,
    in particular, the following query:

    SELECT page, url
    FROM `httparchive.all.requests`
    WHERE
    date = '2023-09-01' AND
    client = 'desktop' AND
    is_main_document AND
    REGEXP_CONTAINS(response_body,
    r'(?is)&amp;lt;details[[:space:]][^&amp;gt;]*?[[:space:]]name(=|[[:space:]]|&amp;gt;)')

    This produced 6 urls (for 7 pages; two of them redirect to the
    same URL).  I did view-source: of the 6 urls and based on visual
    inspection found that 0 of the 6 would be broken by shipping this
    feature.  In more detail:

      * 3 of the 6 (associated with the same site, mailchimp.com
        &amp;lt;&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="http://mailchimp.com"&gt;http://mailchimp.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;) had multiple &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements, on
        each of which the name and id attributes had the same value,
        and these values were properly unique (at least among the
        &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements)
      * 1 had a single &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; with name=&amp;quot;somename&amp;quot;
      * 1 had a single &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; with name=&amp;quot;body&amp;quot; and id=&amp;quot;body&amp;quot;; there
        were other elements with this name/id, but none of the others
        were &amp;lt;details&amp;gt;
      * 1 had a single &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; element with a unique-ish looking name

    So none of the pages found used the name attribute in a way that
    would be affected by shipping this feature (i.e., multiple
    &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; elements with the same name).


                    Anticipated spec changes


                    Open questions about a feature may be a source of
                    future web compat or interop issues. Please list
                    open issues (e.g. links to known github issues in
                    the project for the feature specification) whose
                    resolution may introduce web compat/interop risk
                    (e.g., changing to naming or structure of the API
                    in a non-backward-compatible way).

                    There may still be some small changes as part of
                    the process of getting
                    &lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9400"&gt;https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9400&lt;/a&gt;

                    but I hope to implement those before shipping (at
                    least those that happen soon).


        The PR is merged. Is there more work happening on it?


    No.  I sent the intent before the PR was merged.  I do still need
    to follow up on a piece of the discussion there and file an issue
    on html-aam, though.

Hi,

Please update your chromestatus entry to trigger the other 5 review 
categories for this intent. I think it's probably the case that you ended

API spec

Yes

Summary

Adds an 'enterpictureinpicture' action to the Media Session API. Websites 
can register an action handler which can be used to open a 
Picture-in-Picture or Document Picture-in-Picture window.

TAG review

This small addition to the Media Session API doesn’t seem to qualify for a 
TAG review. 

Note that one for video conferencing actions was approved previously at 
&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/608"&gt;https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/608&lt;/a&gt;

TAG review status

N/A

Debuggability

No DevTools changes are required, treated like any other attribute/enum.

Risks


Interoperability and Compatibility
It’s low risk as it's a small addition to an existing API that both Gecko 
and WebKit approve of.


Signals from other implementations (Gecko, WebKit): 

Gecko: No signal

WebKit: No signal - Generally positive feedback when discussed in the Media 
WG, but no official position pursued due to the small nature of the change

Web / Framework developers: Positive 

(&lt;a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WICG/document-picture-in-picture/issues/96"&gt;https://github.com/WICG/document-picture-in-picture/issues/96&lt;/a&gt;)

The above citation is one example amongst many where developers want to be 
able to initiate pip through other means (e.g. automatically when switching 
tabs or when a picture-in-picture button is pressed in browser UI), and 
having a media session action for this enables the UA to allow the website 
to open a picture-in-picture window in these cases


Ergonomics:

N/A: small addition to an enum of an existing API

Activation:

Web developers will be able to simply set/unset a media session action 
handler for “enterpictureinpicture” to make use of this change. When the 
action name is not supported, it raises a TypeError which can be caught to 
detect feature support.

Is this feature fully tested by web-platform-tests?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm not sure what the general flow for enrollment in DevTools will
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; look like, but if there's a general flow to detect when enrollment is
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; missing for other APIs that check at runtime, we can try to integrate 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; with
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; that when PST calls are made with an unregistered issuer.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Also I think Mike's question on devtools support is worth
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; answering.
