        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Navigate to https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/live/PoLdbOX (this is a demo taken from https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/heap-snapshots)
2. Click "create scattered objects" once
3. Open up developer tools
4. Navigate to the "Memory" tab
5. Take a heap snapshot
6. In the constructors view, go to Item (which should have x20003 next to it) and expand this
7. Navigate quite a bit down to the 50th item and click this
8. In the retainers view right click "[50] in Array", then "reveal in summary view"
7. On the bottom in retainers  right click one of the leaf nodes and select "Reveal In Summary View"
8. Ah we meant to click the "X in Item", it's awkward to go back to where we were.

This is a simplified reproduction, but in some larger projects where you can go quite deep in the retainers view, it can take you a while to get back to your previous position.

# Problem Description
Investigating memory leaks is often a complex task: we frequently explore many avenues, expand numerous retainer trees and make use of the existing navigation features such as Reveal in summary view option.

However, if we find a dead end in our research or simply click something by mistake, it is difficult to recover the previous view. It would be very helpful if the heap snapshot browser allowed for back / forward navigation.

For example, if we use the Reveal in summary view option and then decide that this is not the object we are looking for, we have to manually go back to the previously viewed object and expand its retainer again.

# Additional Comments
## Gif
The gif illustrates the issue where we look at the retainer for "FinalizationRegistry" and click "Reveal In Summary View". Once this action is taken we can't get back to our previous position to look further down the retainers tree for "FinalizationRegistry".

1. Open up developer tools
2. Navigate to the performance panel
3. Take a performance snapshot for a few seconds and stop
4. When looking at the results, try to search for a span without using ctrl + F

# Problem Description
We have noticed some developers often don’t know they can search through the performance timeline, e.g. to find specific functions in the flame chart. This functionality is available through Ctrl + F shortcut, but it doesn’t seem to be advertised anywhere in the UI.

We think Chrome Developer Tools could improve this to make it clear that the users can search through the performance timeline.

The kebab menu in the top right corner does include a Search option, but this searches through the source files rather than the performance timeline.

This is new in the past couple of days, I think, so I'm regarding this as P0 in case some job is currently creating these duplicate entries and we need to stop it fast! If that's not the case, this can obviously be downgraded. I've no idea if this is just a UI thing (in which case it's unimportant) or the core ClusterFuzz database is actually being corrupted in this way, but the same problem shows up in Crash Statistics.</content>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. open https://tiona.de/
2. install PWA
3. Open PWA, open console
4. In the console, enter next command: navigator.setAppBadge(2) and execute

ER: it sets badge with number "2" to the PWA icon

AR: it doesn't set anything, no errors in the console

# Problem Description
The problem is almost not reproduced on most of devices (Macs), but for some rare users the PWA badge is not set for no reason.

We are using window.navigator.setAppBadge(unreadNotifications) for setting PWA badge. It works for 99% of users and we had no problem with it. But for some special cases, sometimes, for some users in the specific site it doesn't work. We have a user, which has a stable reproduce of this kind of error, and nothing helps to return badge back. Even more, on the other site (our inner pre-prod env) it works for him (and for all other sites too). Both sites have exactly the same docker images and configs - so manifest, SW and other things are same.

In order to fix or reproduce the problem we have tried to:
- Manipulating with workers - deleting, updating, stopping
- Disabling all Chrome extensions
- Creating a clean Chrome profile
- Restarting the Mac
- Reinstalling the PWA several times
- Exploring chrome://flags
- Digging into Mac's system settings
- Attempted to incorrectly install the PWA (unsuccessful)
- Reviewed the documentation and potential issues - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Badging_API
- Reviewed current issues in Chrome - https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=setAppBadge&amp;pli=1
- Disabling the manifest to prevent SW registrations
- Turning off the internet/network

None of those steps helped with reproducing or fixing the problem.

I am out of ideas why this command doesn't work on exactly one site, but works for every other sites and the same site instance on the other domain. 
Please, if you know where should I investigate or what I could provide to understand the problem - please let me know.

Thank you!

        <content type="html">**Questions Regarding Contribution to Touchscreen Automation Project**

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my enthusiasm for contributing to the open-source community and my keen interest in the Touchscreen Automation Project outlined above. I am fully committed to dedicating my time and skills to see this project through to completion.

As I delve into the details of the project, I have a few questions that I hope you could kindly address:

1. As the project is focused on Chromebook testing, and I currently do not possess a Chromebook, would I still be able to contribute effectively? If so, what alternative methods would be available for testing my code without a Chromebook?

2. Could you provide more insights into Phase 1 as mentioned in the description? Understanding its specifics would greatly aid my understanding of the project's context.

3. The project description has left me with some confusion. Would it be possible to provide additional details to clarify the scope and requirements?

4. Is there already a satisfactory proposal or candidate for this project? I ask this to ensure that my efforts are aligned with the current needs and to avoid any unnecessary duplication of work.

I eagerly anticipate your response and am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this impactful project. Thank you for considering my inquiries.</content>

the `reading_callback_token_` check makes any further StartSensor() calls that occur when the optimal frequency changes in PlatformSensor::UpdateSensorInternal() not to do anything.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Open PDF with narrow image masks (&lt; 7 pixels wide)
2. Print on a Postscript printer (PS Passthrough active)

# Problem Description
Chrome will wrongly encode narrow image masks with a width of less than 7 pixels, or maybe if they are small in general. For those, it will not use CCITTFaxEncode like for larger image masks, but only ASCII85Encode.
In the cases I saw, these were image masks in letters of fonts that use CharProcs where image masks are drawn, with a maximum width of 5 pixels, from 7 pixels on CCITTFaxEncode was used.
Correctly encoded, each line of the bitmap should be one byte, e.g. for a width of 4 pixels, 4 bits for the image and 4 bits padding.
Chrome, however, produces 4 bytes per line, with three extra 0 bytes.
On the Canon and HP printers I tested, this leads to undefined errors when printing, as the printer exits from the filter in the mid of the stream and interprets the rest as Postscript command. Ghostscript does not run into an error, but displays the characters incorrectly (several horizontal lines).

# Additional Comments
Attachments:
reduced_decomp.pdf is a PDF with decompressed streams, created from a real PDF from a customer with all identifiable information removed.
chrometest.ps is the Postscript created by Chrome from the PDF when printing to a PS driver with PS Passthrough.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Open any page long page with several headers
2. Scroll down
3. Observe that headers are invisible from time to time.
3. 

# Problem Description
Chromium should be smart and show headings without extra markup as this wastes human time for no good reason, error prone, and introduces a human factor.

Chromium can display headers as the breadcrumbs pattern (path). https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Breadcrumb_Navigation

Chromium can automatically hide breadcrumbs after 5-15 seconds and make it an option.

Chromium can ignore really small scrolls like 10-20 px and make it an option.

# Additional Comments
I saw really many documentation pages with h1-h6 but without any sticky headers!!! 

# Summary
Chromium doesn't make h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 headers sticky while scrolling vertically.

From ""Settings &gt; About Chrome""
Application version:
Operating system:Android

URLs (if applicable):

Steps to reproduce:
(1) Received unwanted automatic update to Chrome 122.0.6261.64
(2) Open Chrome, about a quarter of formerly open tabs open, but screen freezes, can't move from tab to tab
(3) Chrome crashes, repeat

Expected result:  Update should not reduce functionality of prior version, all open tabs should be restored

Actual result: Chrome crashes and is completely unusable, seems to be exceeding memory capacity

You guys have ruined my ability to do my work using tabs I have been using for 2-3 years that were totally stable with no issue using an older version of Chrome.  I had turned off auto-updates of the Chrome browser to avoid problems like this, I enabled Google Play Store for an unrelated task yesterday, somehow Chrome was able to update itself without my knowledge or consent, now I have the latest version but it is unusable and I can't reopen all my tabs, about 200.  What am I supposed to do to restore my session?  Can you issue a fix or has the app become too bloated for my use?  I wish I could turn back time to avoid getting this update.

The approach  discussed on [whatwg/html's thread](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8972) is to enqueue messages to bc channel while the page is in BFCache, and dispatch them once the page is restored.

An edge case here is when a dedicated worker's channel has joined a bc channel and enters BFCache. A message to a cached dedicated worker's channel should also be enqueued, and dispatched upon restoration. Also, the order of the messages should not be changed.</content>

        <content type="html">This CL (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4916596) is introducing possible 3D activity in windows desktop window manager(dwm.exe) when playback video with overlay enabled.

Step to reproduce:
0. Make sure you test on a Windows platform with hardware supports overlay.(For example, Intel devices).
1. With any Chrome at M120 or later,  navigate to https://taste1981.github.io/workspace/overlay/video_css_bug.html. Make sure your display resolution is at least 1080p. Chrome windows is maximized. Make sure the cursor is out of the video window.
2. On Windows, update your display settings. For example, change the scale from 100% to 125%, and/or optionally update the resolution.
3. While the video is visible, open Windows task manager, switch to performance-&gt;GPU tab, and watch the 3D utility.

Expected result:
1. No or minimal 3D activity observed during the video playback.
2. Video should be overlayed.

Actual result:
1. Obvious 3D activity is observed when you change the scale/resolution. There might be a configuration that you don't see the 3D activity.
2. If you start Chrome with --show-dc-layer-debug-borders,  you'll see the video is overlayed.

Is this a regression:
Yes. Looks like to be a regression since M120 with above mentioned CL.</content>
