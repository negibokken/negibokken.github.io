        <title>Bad mmap address hint </title>

        <content type="html">[`OS::GetRandomMmapAddr`](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/main/src/base/platform/platform-posix.cc#L301) is used to generate an address hint for `mmap`, with the intent of randomizing allocations (as a security measure). Here a random value is truncated and aligned according to the platform's address space.

However, the [46-bits truncation for ARM64](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/main/src/base/platform/platform-posix.cc#L336) is almost always too high. The default [kconfig setting](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.7/arch/arm64/Kconfig#L1262) for VA_BITS on ARM64 with 4K pages is 39. As a result the hint is ignored and allocations are not being correctly randomized.

We experienced a similar issue on Hermes and recently fixed that: [1](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/d62b96ea44dd8850cd5f6e26d2de842177dc7c22)[2](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/30a9eb6ff35418ec1e478ea94de4481bbdd7a9bc)

Here are some tests showing the issue (ran on an arm64-v8a android emulator).  
Mmap without hint (addresses are predictable):
```
(lldb) p (void*)mmap(0,0x100,0,34,-1,0)
(void *) 0x0000007b4d38e000
(lldb) p (void*)mmap(0,0x100,0,34,-1,0)
(void *) 0x0000007b4d38d000
(lldb) p (void*)mmap(0,0x100,0,34,-1,0)
(void *) 0x0000007b321a5000
```

Mmap with random hint truncated to 46-bit (address are still predictable):
```
(lldb) p/x (((uint64_t)(rand_u32()) &lt;&lt; 32) | ((uint64_t)((rand_u32())))) &amp; 0x3FFFFFFFF000
(uint64_t) 0x00001ccf8614c000
(lldb) p (void*)mmap(0x00001ccf8614c000,0x100,0,34,-1,0)
(void *) 0x0000007b32196000
(lldb) p/x (((uint64_t)(rand_u32()) &lt;&lt; 32) | ((uint64_t)((rand_u32())))) &amp; 0x3FFFFFFFF000
(uint64_t) 0x000029b110409000
(lldb) p (void*)mmap(0x000029b110409000,0x100,0,34,-1,0)
(void *) 0x0000007b32195000
```

Mmap with random hint truncated to 39-bit (hint is used correctly):
```
(lldb) p/x (((uint64_t)(rand_u32()) &lt;&lt; 32) | ((uint64_t)((rand_u32())))) &amp; 0x37FFFFF000
(uint64_t) 0x00000006d923a000
(lldb) p (void*)mmap(0x00000006d923a000,0x100,0,34,-1,0)
(void *) 0x00000006d923a000
(lldb) p/x (((uint64_t)(rand_u32()) &lt;&lt; 32) | ((uint64_t)((rand_u32())))) &amp; 0x37FFFFF000
(uint64_t) 0x000000213268e000
(lldb) p (void*)mmap(0x000000213268e000,0x100,0,34,-1,0)

        <content type="html">With `LayoutObject::UpdateLayout()` having been renamed to `UpdateSVGLayout()` and made SVG-specific, we can allow ourselves to tailor it further to SVG needs to remove some architectural warts. Some ideas in this direction:

1) Simplify "downward" propagation of layout state by passing a struct to the function in question (c.f `SVGContentContainer`).

2) Add "upward" propagation of layout state by returning a struct from the function. This should allow, for example, the "boundaries update" (thus making progress on/fixing issue 41003266).</content>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Execute "const newTab = window.open("about:blank", 'New Tab Target');"
2. Execute "newTab.location = 'https://google.com'"
3. Repeat the same process.

# Problem Description
"If I execute 'window.open("about:blank", 'New Tab Target');' more than once, and if it has the same target, the behavior should be that this URL should open on the same page as the target. However, from some updates onwards, this stopped working, and every time it is executed, it opens a new tab instead of just overwriting the content of the previously opened page."

# Summary
The target with a specific name in window.open is not causing it to open in the same page (JS).

        <content type="html">We were assuming that the default folder for bookmarks with a signed-in user who enable bookmark syncing was always in the account model.
This is not the case, because user may not yet have entered their passphrase.

The question is: what sentence should be displayed to the user in this case ?
Should we tell the user it’s saved only on the device, given that the user currently can’t save bookmark online (but will be able too as soon as the passphrase is entered)
Should we give the name of the folder (that is "mobile bookmarks") ?

We don’t currently have a sentence that state it’s local only and do not contain the name of the folder. If we select those two choices, Meggyn, please provide us with a sentence.


Note that, n order to quickly correct the crash in crbug.com/335234226 and porting the correction to beta, will decide to use the sentence "Bookmark saved to "{title}". It is saved only to this device."  But we hope it to be a temporary choice, that is only there because we can’t backport new string in beta.</content>

        <content type="html">When the user is signed-in, our code assume there is an account storage.
However, if the user uses a passphrase and didn’t enter it, it may not be the case. So the entire UI should be checked for bug.

In particular:
* crbug/335234226 causes a crash
* the snackbar message with default folder gives the folder name, which shouldn’t be the case as it’s the default folder
* the folder selector display the name of the section "only on this device" and "in your google account", even allowing to create folder in account storage.</content>

- ScrollLayer event: has NodeIds
- DecodeImage/ResizeImage: find nodeIds from the previous PaintImage event
- DrawLazyPixelRef: node ids from the previous PaintImage event

        <content type="html">We Nest devinfra team has started to work on moving out Nest gWifi cBuildbot from ChromeOS infrastructure. For separating the resources, we created our own GCP project `nest-gwifi-cbuildbot` and reuses [Chrome image creator process](https://go/cros-infra-bot-creation-docs) to create ChromeOS specific images.

This process is expected to be triggered by [bots of atl97 data center](https://chrome-swarming.appspot.com/bot?id=vm91-m0) and ssh to our GCE instance with [this explicit exposure defined on MirACL](https://source.corp.google.com/piper///depot/google3/googledata/security/miracl/resources/gcp/gce/google.com/teams/nest-gwifi-cbuildbot/default/external/allow-tcp-for-atl97.exp), which has already been picked by our VPC firewall rules. Unfortunately, [it still fails with connection timeout error](https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/infra-internal/builders/prod/ccompute-nest-gwifi-focal64/b8749989427509288481/overview).

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Use Chrome &gt;= 123 and visit https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-bsxjbd
2. Keep an eye on the terminal at the bottom
3. Notice how slow the dependencies install and how slow the initial build is
4. Scroll through the terminal output and search for `Application bundle generation complete`
5. Notice how it takes (on my machine)  `19.335 seconds`

Now download 122 via `npx @puppeteer/browsers install chrome@122` and re-run the steps above.

Notice how the dependencies install much faster and the build is orders of magnitude faster.

On my end, dependencies are installed in `4s` and the build finishes in `2.990 seconds`.

# Problem Description
As described above, there seems to be a performance regression in Chrome starting from version 123. If I install an older version it's pretty fast. We asked multiple people internally to verify the issue and it seems to be affecting macOS, but hard to tell. So far Linux users haven't reported the issue. Some more information from our folks internally:

```
Mac (Venture 13.5)
13.769 seconds, Chrome Version 123.0.6312.122 (Official Build) (arm64)
18.779 seconds, Chrome Version Version 124.0.6367.62 (Official Build) (arm64)
1.874 seconds, Brave Version 1.64.122 Chromium: 123.0.6312.122 (Official Build) (arm64)
```

```

25.852 seconds, Chrome Canary 126.0.6423.0
4.097 seconds, Brave 1.64.122 (Chromium 123.0.6312.122)
```

```
1.934 seconds, Chrome Version 123.0.6312.123 (Official Build) (arm64) - M3
12.536 seconds, Chrome Version 125.0.6422.3 (Official Build) (arm64) - M3
```

Our customers are reporting the same issue so it's actually affecting quite a lot of people.

1. Use Puppeteer / print to PDF ( description and code: https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/12301 )
2. Set up a Footer Template
3. Make an element 1px out of the document's bounds
4. The whole element is missing from PDF

# Problem Description
I print an HTML to PDF, and attach a custom Footer with some dynamic elements being positioned.
Previously elements out of bounds got partially cut. Recently the elements got completely removed even if they are 1px out of the footer box.

# Summary
When an element is partially out of bounds it is not rendered to PDF at all.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Install a Macintosh keyboard mapping that defines alt-v as a dead-key, for instance: https://wiesmann.codiferes.net/wordpress/things/computer-resources/swiss-french-extended-keyboard
2. Start Chrome 
3. Go to a web-site with a textarea, like https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvdaTracAttachments/388/textarea.html
4. Copy the word bug into the clipboard.
5. In the empty text area, type alt-v + s

# Problem Description
The expected result should be the character 'š', the alt-v sequence is handled by the keyboard into a dead key with the caron accent, followed by the s character, yielding š. Doing a paste on alt-v is incorrect behaviour on the Mac (this is command + v). 
Notes:
* Safari handles this perfectly.
* The behaviour is inconsistent with text inputs where alt-v is consumed, but does not produce a paste even. 

# Summary
Chrome Mac maps the alt-v to paste. This breaks keyboard mappings that define alt-v.

        <content type="html">See https://g-issues.chromium.org/issues/333756602 for an example.

This is what we would expect to happen (and did happen in the past):

1. Chromeperf creates a performance alert and an associated issue.
2. An automatic bisection job is started.
3. When the job finishes the issue is either assigned the culprit CL author or to the current v8 performance gardener (if no culprit is found or the job fails).

What actually happens is that step (3) never happens.

I suspect that this could be related to the buganizer migration.

The result is that currently most performance alerts (i.e., any alert that does normally not need manual triaging) end up not being fixed.  This issue currently severely impacts V8's ability to deliver on our toplevel OKRs.

I discovered that due to this bug we currently have about 250 unresolved performance issues open pending assignment. see https://g-issues.chromium.org/issues?q=status:open%20componentid:1457332%20V8 . It would be really important for the jobs which already succeeded could be made to retroactively assign issues to the correct owners.

Here is an example of an email we used to get:

        <content type="html">We now have a system in place to add logs to RPP:

https://chromium.googlesource.com/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/HEAD/docs/visual_logging.md

We need to implement this into the Performance panel and improve our understanding of it to best use it for all new features moving forwards.

For now, let's start with some basic logs:

1. When a user records a fresh trace.
2. When a user imports a saved trace.
3. When a user exports a trace to JSON.</content>

        <content type="html">To produce this issue, run below code in Chrome Canary:

```
const context = await navigator.ml.createContext({ deviceType: "gpu" });  
const builder = new MLGraphBuilder(context);

2. I don't understand, it kicked me back to start after.
3. Uploading screenshots 

# Problem Description
This person has access to all my account even made new fake ones for my new phone I got and still there in it. I'm so tired of no one being able to help me. Or even believe me for that matter. 

You guys are developers, I am not at all and everything is very confusing, I just know this person can switch and use my settings for there benefit.

I even got a new number with my new phone and this MF somehow had my brand new number I just got into my 4 year old phone somehow. And using mobile Hotspot with my 4 year old phone which was completely turned off and unused for 4 fucking months?

How the F is that even possible, I'm so desperate for help.

https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/chrome/common/extensions/api/_features.md#requires_delegated_availability_check

Note: Chrome is not responsible for bugs or behavior of individual extensions.

What steps will reproduce the problem?

(1) Create a new feature entry in https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/chrome/common/extensions/api/_api_features.json

(2) Enable the delegated availability check by setting `requires_delegated_availability_check` property to `true`

(3) Add `matches` property and specify an allowlist.

(4) Check the extension API availability.

What is the expected result?
Existing properties should also be honored when the delegated availability check is specified.

What happens instead?
`matches` property is not considered. When a delegated availability check is present, features only use the handler to check the feature availability even when other properties like `matches` are specified.

This is because `SimpleFeature::IsAvailableToContextImpl` returns early when a delegated handler is specified : https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:extensions/common/features/simple_feature.cc;drc=316185d068318c45f64f36f77bda9f436cf71e23;l=288

Does this issue affect a publicly-available extension?  If so, please include its ID here.
N/A

If this is a regression (i.e., worked before), please consider using the bisect tool (https://www.chromium.org/developers/bisect-builds-py) to help us identify the root cause and more rapidly triage the issue.

React Complex DOM (and probably others) spend ~0.8% of time building SVG Paths (mostly from bytestreams, but sometimes from rect?). We can likely add a `HashMap&lt;Something, WeakMember&lt;Path&gt;&gt;` in front of `LayoutSVGShape::CreatePath()`.
A lot of these benchmarks might be using the same SVG multiple times.
