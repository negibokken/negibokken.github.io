        <content type="html">Hello, I hope you're doing well üòä

I've encountered a display issue on the Google Search page. When the "Tools" menu is expanded and I click on the "More" button to display its tooltip, the tooltip is obscured by the "Tools" submenu.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to the Google search page.
2. Click on the "Tools" button (labeled "Outils" in my screenshots, as I'm French), and a submenu will appear.
3. Click on the "More" button (labeled "Plus" in French), and a tooltip will appear.
4. ‚ùå Issue: Notice that the tooltip is hidden under the "Tools" submenu.

**Expected Behavior:**
The tooltip should either disappear or remain on top of the submenu.

**Environment:**
- Operating System: MacOS Version 14.4.1 (23E224)
- Browsers where issue can be reproduced: 
  - ‚ùå Chrome 124.0.6367.61 (Build officiel) (arm64)
  - ‚ùå Firefox 125.0.2 (64-bit)

**Note:**

I was not sure about the exact component to assign this issue to.

Have a nice day.</content>

It would be amazing, and probably speed up pinpoint jobs as well, if this was an option to select (maybe even default) when creating a job.</content>

1. Ridiculous question.
2. All bookmarks are just POOF gone
3. 

# Problem Description
PLEASE is there a way to restore my history, saved passwords, bookmarks! This is  a nightmare. was all working fine, and then BAM, I don't know why but my account didn't pop up anymore when I signed opened google, i had to re enter password each time I wanted to get in to find out what was wrong, I had earlier been in an incognito window that I closed. Spotify keeps randomly opening on my computer and I had to force quite it a few times. This is MESSED UP! We just go this new macBook air a few weeks ago and had not done a formal backup on it yet as we never had to do that on our old one. So 10 years of carefully curated bookmarks all gone!! Save passwords, everything?

# Additional Comments
Already commented on another thread and got response that my issue was different. I do not even know how to explain how it is different. I just know that I was using all my bookmarks, passwords, etc yesterday and then POOF I was signed out of my google account and kept having to sign in again, and when I did NONE of my bookmarks were there anymore. 

# Summary
Lost All bookmarks, history, saved passwords on chrome instantly!

        <title>Migrate Chromium TODOs from Monorail IDs to new IssueTracker IDs</title>
        <author>
            <name>ag...@google.com</name>

        <content type="html">External tracker version of b/321899722

Chromium code contains lots of TODOs with crbug links, usually in the form:

```
// TODO(12345): Fix the thing.
```
or sometimes
```
// TODO(crbug/12345): Fix the thing.
```
or
```
// TODO(crbug.com/12345): Fix the thing.
```

With the migration from Monorail to the new Chromium Issue Tracker, these IDs no longer match the IDs in the bugs. There is a redirection service that allows you to get to the correct bug from a link in the code base but if you have a bug assigned to you and want to find any references to it in the code base, that is challenging. 

Many instances of this are being automatically fixed but if you need to manually make a fix, all you need to do is navigate to the bug and then grab the new ID from the URL. Also make sure to use the canonical bug format which is `TODO(crbug.com/123456789)`.</content>

Stops working when the object has been hit with a bug that causes the time to be offset by 3 hours 

Steps to reproduce:
(1)hack the WiFi
(2)backdoor the encryption of the email address 
(3)make the user access account a child account and create a secure password for your developer account and then create a new application for your user download;  for their personal account; in which case you control ultimately giving you totally control of the content of the site and the users account for your own personal content as well as your own personal data for the site itself as you choose which content you want to publish on your own website as well as any other social networking platform 

Expected result:


Actual result: hackers can use the data from their computers to steal the information from the server without having to use a password manager or a security guard to access the server and retrieve data from the servers themselves and then steal the information that they use to access the data stored in the servers themselves without having access to the server‚Äôs computer or the server‚Äôs computer itself and without having to worry about any other information being shared by anyone who uses a password manager to access their data and account information stored within the system itself and to make it easier access it to be able to use their own servers without any real security risk for personal data protection or other security concerns in order to avoid being exploited by a computer system or any of these other services that could potentially affect their personal information </content>

        <content type="html">I've made an attempt to convert one of sign-in interactive tests to Kombucha in https://crrev.com/c/5476472/1 which failed because the dialog wasn't receiving an accelerator event send via SendAccelerator().

SignInViewControllerBrowserTest.EmailConfirmationDefaultFocus is quite simple: 
1. open sign-in email confirmation WebUI dialog 
2. wait until the page is "ready"
3. send RETURN key
4. verify that the dialog executes a default action and closes

[Kombucha version](https://crrev.com/c/5476472/1) of the test fails at step 3. The test passes if I press the "Enter" key manually. The issue might be that we don't wait enough in 2. but I doubt it. Inserting `FlushTasks()` before sending accelerator event didn't help.

Kombucha [had issues](https://crrev.com/c/4931440) with sending accelerator events to WebUI previously and I think that I'm hitting another instance of the same problem.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Create a scrollable fixed size parent element with direction: rtl and make it scrollable
2. Create a direct child element with position: sticky attribute with top (and/or right) set to 0

The sticky child element will not actually be sticky and will disappear when the user scrolls too far. Do note that if you put a sticky element inside of the second child, it will actually work so the problem is really restricted to the direct children of the scrollable element. Here is a codepen to illustrate the problem: https://codepen.io/Julien-Carion/pen/OJGdxBd 
This may or may not be linked to https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40858399

# Summary
The position: sticky attribute isn't working properly in RTL

# Custom Questions
#### Example URL: 
https://codepen.io/Julien-Carion/pen/OJGdxBd

#### Does the problem occur on multiple sites?
Yes - Please describe below

#### Is it a problem with a plugin?
No - It's the browser itself

#### Does this feature work correctly in other browsers?
No - I can reproduce the problem in another browser

#### Which other browsers (including versions) also have the problem?
Safari, Edge (works in firefox)

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Create a custom element with a shadow root.
2. Add to the custom element's shadow root a SLOT element. Also add a STYLE element with the following CSS: "::slotted(input)::-webkit-inner-spin-button { display: none; }".
3. Pass on a INPUT element of type "number" to the custom element.
4. Hover over the INPUT element and see that the spin buttons are still there. The slotted styles are not being applied.

# Problem Description
One way to hide the spin buttons (up/down arrows) inside an input of type "number" is by applying the following CSS:
::-webkit-inner-spin-button { display: none; }
But when the input element is slotted into a custom element, and the custom element tries to apply these styles, then this does not work. Selector used:
::slotted(input)::-webkit-inner-spin-button { display: none; }
(The same may go for "webkit-outer-spin-button")

# Additional Comments
See attached "index.html" for the broken scenario, as well as a working scenario (without custom element).
OS: macOS 14.4.1

# Summary
CSS selector "::slotted(input)::-webkit-inner-spin-button" does not work.

# Custom Questions
#### Which component does this fall under?
Blink&gt;CSS

#### Does this work in other browsers? 
Not sure - I don't know

        <content type="html">Chromium is the only engine that has shipped this API. But our view on it has changed over time. From our [updated guidance on long tasks](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-long-tasks#isinputpending):

&gt; since the launch of that API, our understanding of yielding has improved, especially after the introduction of INP. We **no longer recommend using this API**, and instead recommend yielding **regardless of whether input is pending or not**.

The [current usage](https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/2794) is too high to unship immediately, so the first step is to add more metrics to understand where the usage is coming from and whether it can be easily changed.</content>

# Fatal error in ../../test/cctest/test-api.cc, line 3294
# Check failed: o1-&gt;GetIdentityHash() != o2-&gt;GetIdentityHash() (471595 vs. 471595).
```

Notice that the random seed is important; with a different value it (most probably) will not crash.

I bisected it to [this CL](https://crrev.com/c/4839486), which landed in September 2023 and flipped the flag for snapshot rehashing. Indeed, the invocation above does not fail with `--rehash-snapshot`. But I don't think that the issue is related to that CL or the snapshot. Rehashing the snapshot uses more random numbers from the generator, so we would just need a different seed to make it fail again.

I think this is simply a case where the random number generator gives the same hash to two different objects.</content>

        <content type="html">Pairing is failing with Pixel Phones 4a,3a,6

Ref Devices: Pixel 3a,4a,and 6.

Steps:
	1. Keep the IUT on discoverable mode
	2. Pair from Pixel 4a,3a,6
	
Analysis:

	Ref device is sending 'IO Capability Request' event is before 'Read Remote Extended Features' event received.
	
	IUT will reply to 'IO Capability Request' with 'IO Capability Request Reply' command only after receiving 'Read Remote Extended Features' event [for which IUT send cmd Read Remote Extended Features].
	In case of Pixel 4a,3a, and 6, these ref devices are sending 'IO Capability Request' event before 'Read Remote Extended Features' event received.Hence IUT is not sending 'IO Capability Request Reply' command which leads pairing failure.
	
    Tested with other Android phones, pairing is working correctly. 'IO Capability Request' event is sent [from other Android Phones] after 'Read Remote Extended Features' event received. and IUT responded with 'IO Capability Request Reply' command and Pairing succeeded.

        <content type="html">Repro URL: https://deploy-preview-2--view-transitions.netlify.app/stack-navigator/mpa/
Chrome Version: All
Recording: Attached

The linked to demo is an MPA with three pages. There‚Äôs MPA View Transitions going on between the pages, but that‚Äôs not relevant here - it also triggers in Chrome Stable which has no Cross-Document View Transitions support.

When navigating from one page to the other, the custom cursor that is declared gets shown, as expected.

```css
* {
    cursor: url(/stack-navigator/shared/cursor.svg) 16 16, auto !important;
}
*:active {
  cursor: url(/stack-navigator/shared/cursor-active.svg) 16 16, auto !important;
}
```

However, when clicking the little back arrow in the UI - which triggers a `navigation.back()` behind the scenes ‚Äì the custom cursor no longer shows. Hit detection on the page still works though, as seen in the attached recording.

To get the custom cursor to show again, the user needs to actively click the page.

Noteworthy is that the same happens when using the UA back button: after doing so, the custom cursor is not shown.
However, when performing a chain of back-forwards-back clicks (using the UA back/forward buttons) the custom cursor does show on the first page.

...
  auto keysym = XKeysymForWindowsKeyCode(key_code, false);
  auto keycode = connection_-&gt;KeysymToKeycode(keysym);
}
after XKeysymForWindowsKeyCode(...) and KeysymToKeycode(...), if the input argument key_code=0,  the value keycode will 
be transformed to an UnExpeced keycode!!! And an unexpected shortcut is registered.
On my Ubuntu 23.04/GNOME(X11),  keycode is transformed to 204 and will make Alt_L shortcut registered. Other OSs may be different, LMDE6 will be BackSpace.
We can use command "xmodmap -pk | grep ${KEYCODE}" to check keysym for KEYCODE.

To Reproduce:
My test code keysymbug.c(Attacehed), compile with "gcc -Wno-deprecated-declarations -o keysymbug keysymbug.c -lX11".
Run keysymbug(test code), will produce output:
src keycode(0x0)-&gt;keysym(0x0:(null))

        <content type="html">Bug is visible on the latest Chrome:
Chrome Version: 124.0.6367.61 (64-bit) (cohort: Stable) 
OS: Windows 11 Version 23H2 (Build 22631.3447)

I've tested archive builds and traced regression:

88.0.4289.0 dev - broken
815960 e8d15ca69fd9c9ae88a589018a069a9b5569e123

88.0.4286.0 dev - ok
814962 5034c8b9252e1cb6dd75fbfea8f184c53de8de0b

I didn't verify this, but probably this [Skia update] (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/98a887fbb1fa0992e2220260acf54291a58d7362)
introduced this problem

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1)  Open a page with a box-shadow, eg.: 

&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;div style="width:660px; height: 310px; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 225px 84px black;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

(2) Gradually change the browser window size to roughly match the size of the div

What is the expected result?
Applied box-shadow stays intact 

What happens instead?
At some window height value the graphical artifact will start to appear at the bottom of the div
