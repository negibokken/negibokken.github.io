```

Given the flake rate and when the first flake occurred, I don't think this is related to the recent WebGL roll on the 16th, as I would expect flakes to show up earlier than the linked build in that case.

Since this is a validating decoder-only issue, this is a low priority issue.</content>

        <content type="html">This bug is for all test failures where the primary error message is similiar to the following (ignoring numbers and hexadecimal values):
view.cc(2710): Check failed: parent_layer == layer()-&gt;parent() (000024B401EFFB80 vs. 0000000000000000)

The following test(s) were observed to have matching failures at this time (at most five examples listed):
- ninja://chrome/test:browser_tests/PageInfoBubbleViewDialogBrowserTest.InvokeUi_TrackingProtection3pcLimited
- ninja://chrome/test:browser_tests/PageInfoBubbleViewDialogBrowserTest.InvokeUi_TrackingProtection3pcAllowedForSite
- ninja://chrome/test:browser_tests/PageInfoBubbleViewDialogBrowserTest.InvokeUi_TrackingProtection3pcBlocked
- ninja://chrome/test:browser_tests/PageInfoBubbleViewBrowserTestWithRedInterstitialFaceliftEnabled.UnwantedSoftwareNewStrings


These test failures are causing problem(s) which require your attention, including:
- test variant(s) are being exonerated (ignored) in presubmit

[This build](https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromium/builders/ci/Android%20FYI%20Release%20(Pixel%204)/47946/infra) appears to be the first occurrence of the failure, but flakiness seems to have increased around [this build](https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromium/builders/ci/Android%20FYI%20Release%20(Pixel%204)/47956/infra). Both of those are before the recent WebGL roll, though, so I don't think we can attribute the increased flakiness to that.</content>

        <title>Chrome Accepts An End-Entity Certificate with OCSP Signing EKU While Firefox Rejects It</title>

            <name>pi...@gmail.com</name>

        <summary>-</summary>
        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Generating a mutated digital certificate with an additional Subject Alternative Name (SAN) of "ypj.test.com", along with its corresponding root CA and private key.
2. Configuring an Nginx web server to use the mutated certificate in HTTPS mode.
3. Setting up the local machine (127.0.0.1) as the server and mapping "ypj.test.com" to 127.0.0.1 in the hosts file. 
4. Adding the root CA to the system's trusted root certificate store using certutil.
5. Running nginx.exe. Accessing the URL "https://ypj.test.com:443" in a web browser, where the certificate's SAN matches the URL.

# Problem Description
I have encountered a potential security issue where end-entity certificates that include the OCSP Signing Extended Key Usage (EKU) are being accepted. Standards and best practices typically reserve the OCSP Signing EKU for certificates specifically authorized to sign OCSP responses, not for general end-entity purposes such as server or client authentication.
Chrome has accepted these certificates; however, Firefox appropriately rejects them while displaying the 'SEC_ERROR_INADEQUATE_CERT_TYPE Error'. The Firefox development team has also pointed out that there's really no reason for an end-entity certificate to have the OCSP signing EKU, adhering to the principle of least privilege and the intended use of the certificate.
To enhance the strictness and security of the implementation, Chrome should reject end-entity certificates with the OCSP Signing Extended Key Usage (EKU) to prevent entities from issuing fraudulent OCSP responses. This precaution is necessary as the OCSP Signing EKU should be exclusive to entities expressly authorized to handle certificate revocation statuses, thus preserving the trustworthiness of the OCSP system.

        <title>Images in a flex container don't update sizing properly</title>
        <author>
            <name>pi...@gmail.com</name>

        <summary>-</summary>
        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Have a flex container with a child image
2. Set the flex container height to 0px
3. Load the page
4. Remove the height on the flex container
5. You would expect image to load but it doesn't.

# Problem Description
Images that are the child of a flex container don't update their sizing when the flex container height is removed. If something else triggers the image to update, then it will update properly. This can be changing the src or adding a border to the image (assuming other things). 

Example: https://jsfiddle.net/m5h0b7q9/7/

When you press the "Show Image" button it removes the "hide" class and the image should show up but it doesn't.

This was working on previous versions of Chrome.

# Summary
Images in a flex container don't update sizing properly

# Custom Questions
#### Which component does this fall under?
Not sure - I don't know

#### Does this work in other browsers? 
Yes - This is just a Chrome problem

        <content type="html">As discussed in issue 41437527, IsHostnameNonUnique() returns true for a TLD (e.g. "com"). This is probably fine for most users of that function, but it's a little weird because the Baseline Requirements allow publicly trusted CAs to issue certificates for TLDs (per my interpretation, at least). We should see if we can make that function return false for TLDs, without wreaking havoc on other callsites.

        <content type="html">This came up in: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5375183 for b/329346768

Currently gesture recognition and dispatch in the Browser process can determine that there are multiple gestures to forward to the target Renderer. Such as:
  -  GestureScrollUpdate with a GestureScrollBegin
  -  GestureScrollUpdate with a GesturePinchUpdate (when pinch is occurring)

However we dispatch each of these as a separate message. Which can lead to input intended for a VSync arriving on each side of the VSync. Some code, such as `blink::CompositorThreadEventQueue` expect the pinches to be accompanied by scrolls. While for `GestureScrollBegin` the delay can lead to the scroll update missing the VSync completely.

We should look to batch these together</content>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Download the sample extension showing the issue (https://github.com/tbrockman/chrome-remove-permissions-bug.git)
2. Load the extension unpacked
3. Click "Add Permission" in the popup (and grant the permissions)
4. Verify that permission is added (under Site access in extension details)
5. Click "Remove Permission" in the popup
6. See that the permission hasn't been removed (still listed under Site access in extension details) despite the call to remove permissions being successful

# Problem Description
Chrome extension documentation suggests that chrome.permissions.remove should be called once a permission is no longer needed. In an extension I'm building, I've attempted to make all permissions optional, by adding the following to my manifest.json:

```json
"optional_host_permissions": [
    "&lt;all_urls&gt;"
]
```

And then I only dynamically request access to the URL match patterns that the user specifies in a text field in the popup:

```js
chrome.permissions.request({
    permissions: [],
    origins: userSpecifiedOrigins
})
```

If they remove any match patterns, the expectation is that the extension will no longer have those host permissions. Currently, this is not the case, as the call to chrome.permissions.remove doesn't seem to actually remove the permissions. 

For any user (my extension is a dev tool, so the intended audience might be more security conscious than normal) who examines the extension details, they will see that the extension has access to _all_ host permissions they've granted in the past, regardless of what they've currently specified, which is unexpected behavior and erodes trust. Given the propensity of browser extensions to be user for data-mining and other malicious purposes, I'd like to avoid this perception.

        <content type="html">WebView needs to decide if we will be drawing this frame at the BeginFrame time, meaning that BeginFrame events needs to flow if there is any undrawn frames. Normally this isn't an issue, because clients actively submitting frames subscribe to them. 

When it's not the case, webview temporary subscribes to BeginFrame when we receive new CompositorFrame  that is embedded in the last drawn frame. Unfortunately this isn't quite correct for the first frame, because the surface might be not embedded yet.</content>

        <content type="html">Hundreds of files try to convert `bool`s to strings: https://source.chromium.org/search?q=%5C%20%5C%3F%5C%20%5C%22(true%5C%22%5C%20%5C:%5C%20%5C%22false%7Cyes%5C%22%5C%20%5C:%5C%20%5C%22no%7Con%5C%22%5C%20%5C:%5C%20%5C%22off%7C1%5C%22%5C%20%5C:%5C%20%5C%220)%5C%22%20lang:c%2B%2B%20(-f:third_party%20OR%20f:third_party%2Fblink)&amp;ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc

Some of them even define bespoke helpers just to do this: https://source.chromium.org/search?q=(string%7Cchar%5C*)%5C%20BoolTo%20(-f:third_party%20OR%20f:third_party%2Fblink)%20lang:c%2B%2B%20case:yes&amp;ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc

After some discussion on #base, I think we should do the following:
* [P1] Convert `base::ToString()` to stringify `bool`s as "true"/"false" instead of the current "1"/"0". This is more human-readable and better matches `std::format()`.
* [P3] Audit sites above that use a different pair of strings, and where possible, change them to "true"/"false". (Claim: we should do this for anything that wouldn't break automated parsing in a way we can't trivially fix.)
* [P2] Convert sites that manually stringify as "true"/"false" to use `base::ToString()`. More useful than the bullet above, but listed after it to imply that anything it covers would then come under this too.

For posterity, it is possible to add configurability to how `ToString()` stringifies bools:
```
// Using an enum class forces casts to compose the values, and an enum without
// the struct exposes the member names namespace-wide.
struct Fmt {
  enum Flags {
    kNone = 0,
    kBoolYN = 1 &lt;&lt; 0,
    // Add more as needed
  };
};

template &lt;uint32_t Options = Fmt::kNone, typename... Ts&gt;
std::string ToString(const Ts&amp;... values) {
  std::ostringstream ss;
  ss.setf(std::ios_base::boolalpha);

  if constexpr (Options &amp; Fmt::kBoolYN) {
    struct BoolYN : std::numpunct&lt;char&gt; {
      using std::numpunct&lt;char&gt;::numpunct;
      std::string do_truename() const { return "yes"; }
      std::string do_falsename() const { return "no"; }
    };
    static auto* const bool_yn = new BoolYN(1);  // Would use NoDestructor
    ss.imbue(std::locale(ss.getloc(), bool_yn));
  }

  (...,
   internal::ToStringHelper&lt;std::remove_cvref_t&lt;decltype(values)&gt;&gt;::Stringify(
       values, ss));
  return ss.str();
}
```

I don't think this is worth doing. Making the API configurable has downsides that don't seem to really outweigh the upsides.</content>
