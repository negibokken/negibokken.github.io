        <title>Remove initiating_element from form_util::ApplyFormAction()</title>

        <summary>-</summary>
        <content type="html">`form_util::ApplyFormAction()` has special treatment for the `initiating_element` parameter. I think we can keep this special treatment but remove that parameter.

Why would removing the `initiating_element` parameter be good?
- `AutofillAgent::last_queried_element_` is passed for that parameter. `last_queried_element_` has a troubled semantics itself. Eliminating references to `last_queried_element_` is a step towards fixing its semantics or eliminating it.
- As a step towards fixing issue 40275791, Jihad has [a CL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5268782/17) that passes the triggered element all the way from the browser to `ApplyFormAction()`. We wouldn't need that if we can eliminate the parameter. We could also simplify his [followup CL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4700769/15) and pass a vector of `FormFieldData::FillData` instead of of a vector of `FormData::FillData` in the mojo message `ApplyFormAction()`.
- The `ApplyFormFunction()` is too complex. Simplifying it would be great.

What is [`initiating_element` parameter](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/autofill/content/renderer/form_autofill_util.cc;l=2213;drc=8b80267364695624baf28f6b4ae7dfe0c1aed9c1) currently used for?
1. It is used to [extract](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/autofill/content/renderer/form_autofill_util.cc;l=2219-2225;drc=8b80267364695624baf28f6b4ae7dfe0c1aed9c1) the `WebFormControlElement`s of a form. This vector is used for three purposes:
   1. It is used in [a loop](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/autofill/content/renderer/form_autofill_util.cc;l=2239-2246;drc=8b80267364695624baf28f6b4ae7dfe0c1aed9c1).
   2. It is used to check that the `initiating_element` is (still) [autofillable](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/autofill/content/renderer/form_autofill_util.cc;l=1736;drc=f4a00cc248dd2dc8ec8759fb51620d47b5114090).
2. If [focused](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/autofill/content/renderer/form_autofill_util.cc;l=2257-2260;drc=f4a00cc248dd2dc8ec8759fb51620d47b5114090), the `initiating_element` gets special treatment with respect to focus: it is autofilled first, and before filling the other fields, a "blur" event is emitted, and finally a "focus" event to move the focus back into the `initiating_element`. This mechanism is needlessly convoluted because there's the second  `initially_focused_element` variable.
3. The `initiating_element` has a weakened [ShouldSkipFillField()](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/autofill/content/renderer/form_autofill_util.cc;l=2251;drc=f4a00cc248dd2dc8ec8759fb51620d47b5114090) check.

Why can we eliminate it? Let's address the above use-cases:
1. Can be easily avoided:
   1. The loop can just call `GetFormControlByRendererId()`. It's dead code at the moment, by the way.
   2. Checking that the `initiating_field` is autofillable is reasonable -- although it covers an edge case, like elements changing from `&lt;input type=text&gt;` to `&lt;input type=button&gt;` while the popup is open -- but if we consider it useful, we should apply it also to the non-initiating fields. So should either eliminate it or move it to one the [main loop](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/autofill/content/renderer/form_autofill_util.cc;l=2258-2263;drc=8b80267364695624baf28f6b4ae7dfe0c1aed9c1).
2. Instead of using distinct `initiating_element` and `initially_focused_element`, we can set `initially_focused_element` to the autofillable that has focus, if such a field exists. The distinction between `initiating_element` and `initially_focused_element` makes a difference only in extreme race conditions because the popup is hidden when the initiating element loses focus before the user accepts a suggestion (i.e., there must be a race between the Mojo messages). In such an extreme case, if the focus has moved to another autofillable field, *that* field should get the special "blur" + "focus" treatment, IMO -- so eliminating `initiating_element` would even be a tiny bug fix.
3. We could instead check in `ShouldSkipFillField()` whether the field has focus. In the worst case, we'd be overwriting autofilled values, like in Case 2, it's only relevant in the extreme edge case, so I think it's practically irrelevant.</content>

        <content type="html">I maintain VirtualGL, an interposer that enables GPU acceleration for OpenGL applications running in Un*x remote desktops (such as VNC.)  Since VirtualGL does not (and probably cannot) support Vulkan, the best way to run Chrome v112+ with VirtualGL is to use ANGLE's EGL/desktop OpenGL back end (`--use-angle=gl-egl`).  However, I experience frequent but intermittent rendering pipeline stalls and other performance issues with that back end, irrespective of VirtualGL (i.e. I observe them on a local display as well, simply by running `google-chrome --use-angle=gl-egl`.)  The issues seem to occur only with nVidia GPUs, and I have observed them with multiple nVidia GPU models, multiple nVidia (proprietary) driver versions, and multiple Linux distributions.

        <title>Consider updating Chrome's X11 visual selection method</title>

        <content type="html">I maintain VirtualGL, an interposer that enables GPU acceleration for OpenGL applications running in Un*x remote desktops (such as VNC.)  Since VirtualGL does not (and probably cannot) support Vulkan, the best way to run Chrome v112+ with VirtualGL is to use ANGLE's EGL/desktop OpenGL back end (`--use-angle=gl-egl`).  However, even though that back end doesn't use GLX, Chrome still picks an X11 visual based on GLXFBConfig attributes that it obtains by sending raw GLX protocol requests to the X server, then it expects to find an EGLConfig whose `EGL_NATIVE_VISUAL_ID` attribute matches that visual.  I don't think it's necessarily valid to assume that a visual obtained using raw GLX protocol requests will automatically map to an EGLConfig, since they are different subsystems.  That assumption seems to be an implementation detail, which means that Chrome's visual selection method may only work by accident.

In VirtualGL, that assumption is definitely not valid.  3D rendering actually occurs on either a "3D X server" (a GPU-attached X display that is separate from the "2D X server" specified in the DISPLAY environment variable) or an EGL device, so there is not a bidirectional mapping between GLXFBConfigs/EGLConfigs and X visuals.  Applications will work fine with VirtualGL if they do one of the following:

1. Choose a GLXFBConfig with specific OpenGL rendering attributes, then call `glXGetVisualFromFBConfig()` to get its associated visual.
2. Use `glXChooseVisual()` to choose a visual with specific OpenGL rendering attributes.
3. Iterate through the available X server visuals, call `glXGetConfig()` to obtain the OpenGL rendering attributes of each, then pick one of the visuals based on those attributes.
4. Choose an EGLConfig with specific OpenGL rendering attributes, then query its `EGL_NATIVE_VISUAL_ID` attribute to get the associated visual.

Basically, Chrome implements Method 3, except that it uses raw GLX protocol requests rather than calling the actual GLX functions.  By using raw GLX protocol requests, Chrome obtains a visual based on OpenGL rendering attributes from the unaccelerated (llvmpipe) OpenGL renderer in the 2D X server, and those attributes are irrelevant in VirtualGL. Because there are no function calls for VirtualGL to interpose, VGL doesn't know which visual Chrome chooses, and it can't ensure that the visual will be mapped to an EGLConfig. Is there a good reason why Chrome can't just call the GLX functions?

The comments in gfx/x/visual_manager.cc seem to indicate that Chrome is mimicking the visual selection method that GTK used to use.  (GTK no longer uses that method, as of v4.3.2.)  However, GTK used GLX function calls rather than raw GLX requests, so it didn't cause these problems with VirtualGL.

        <content type="html">I understand that the ChromeOS Media App is closed source, however, since we removed the built in video player in the Files app, the only way (and default way) to open videos and audio from the Files app is the Media app. The problem is the on ChromiumOS, it is completely empty. It is thus impossible to play media without a third party extension, or manually drag n' dropping it into a browser window.

There should be some sort of shim media app set up that can be made open source, so that the bare minimum needed to open a media file can work. Without this, ChromiumOS is hampered and difficult for developers or for making a production ready custom OS build (like I do with ThoriumOS &gt; https://github.com/Alex313031/ThoriumOS). What I mean is none of the annotations, PDF support (I.E. use_ink), or any of that. Just a simple instance of the built in Chromium media player, enough to at  least play files.</content>

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A B&lt;/div&gt;

span {
  display: inline-block; /** required */
}

div {
  white-space: pre-wrap; /** required */
  width: fit-content; /** required? */
  border: 1px red solid; /** visual aid */
}

# Problem Description
I have a `&lt;div&gt;` containing several `&lt;span&gt;` elements. Each `&lt;span&gt;` contains a letter ("A" or "B") or a space. I have another `&lt;div&gt;` that contains "A", "B", or space, but as a single text (no span wrapped).

For example, the following `&lt;div&gt;` separates each letter or space into its own `&lt;span&gt;`:

```html
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

And this `&lt;div&gt;` keeps everything together, like a complete sentence:

```html
&lt;div&gt;A B&lt;/div&gt;
```

Technically and visually, however, it should be the same content and width. Something like "A B".

However, at least in Chrome (Firefox works fine), when calculating the size of the `&lt;span&gt;` elements in the first `&lt;div&gt;`, we have the following (font: Times New Roman, 16px):

- `&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;` has a width of 11.563px
- `&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;` has a width of 4.00px
- `&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;` has a width of 10.672px

So, technically, we would have a total width of 26.234px. When inspecting this `&lt;div&gt;` in the browser, the displayed value is indeed this. So far, we can consider that it is within the expected standards.

However, the second `&lt;div&gt;` (`&lt;div&gt;A B&lt;/div&gt;`), which has the only difference of not separating the characters between `&lt;span&gt;` elements, the browser reports a size of 25.344px, a small but crucial difference for my application (a "visual fluctuation" of ~1px).

My question is: why is the browser rendering this incorrectly?

If we compare to Firefox, the first `div` (with `span`) has the closest width to the first `div` in relation to Chrome (Chrome: 26.234px in the first and 25.344px in the second, Firefox: 26.2167px in both) .

# Summary
White-space width inconsistency inside inline-block, impacting layout precision

My point is not why doesn't anything happen.

Sure the user might have disabled some of the apps in the chain of commands that are needed.

It doesn't matter.
My point is there should be at least a message.

Yes, you might say well it's not our problem. Well however this is your browser.
PS I'm having a very hard time entering this bug report by a cell phone. You should try it someday.

But the exact page doesn't matter.

# Problem Description
We see this nicely lined up code.

Well all we can do is take a screenshot of it.

If we try any of the copying options, the alignment is lost.

        <content type="html">In today's digital age, romantic connections often begin and flourish through online communication platforms. Chatting has become a prevalent medium for expressing feelings, sharing emotions, and even proposing to someone special. However, proposing a girl on chat requires finesse, sensitivity, and understanding of the medium. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the intricacies of proposing a girl on chat, offering tips, dos and don'ts, and strategies for success.

Establish a Genuine Connection: Before considering proposing to a girl on chat, ensure you have established a genuine connection with her. Engage in meaningful conversations, show interest in her life, and demonstrate that you value her thoughts and opinions. Building a solid foundation of trust and rapport is crucial for a successful proposal.

Choose the Right Moment: Timing is everything when it comes to proposing on chat. Select a moment when both of you are relaxed, and the conversation is flowing smoothly. Avoid popping the question out of the blue or during stressful situations. Create a comfortable atmosphere where she feels open to receiving your proposal.

Express Your Feelings Honestly: Be sincere and authentic in expressing your feelings for her. Choose your words carefully to convey the depth of your emotions. Avoid using clichés or generic lines; instead, speak from the heart. Let her know why she is special to you and how she has impacted your life positively.

Personalize Your Approach: Tailor your proposal to reflect your unique relationship with her. Reference shared memories, inside jokes, or meaningful experiences you've had together. Personalizing your proposal demonstrates thoughtfulness and reinforces the emotional connection between you.

Be Respectful and Considerate: Respect her boundaries and comfort level throughout the conversation. Avoid pressuring her or making her feel obligated to respond a certain way. Give her the space to process your proposal and express her thoughts and feelings at her own pace.

Be Prepared for Any Response: Understand that she may not respond to your proposal immediately or in the way you expect. Be prepared for a range of reactions, including excitement, hesitation, or even rejection. Regardless of her response, handle it gracefully and with maturity.

Follow Up with Communication: After proposing, continue the conversation and address any questions or concerns she may have. Reassure her of your commitment and willingness to support her decision, whatever it may be. Maintain open lines of communication to navigate the next steps in your relationship together.

Respect Her Decision: Ultimately, respect her decision, whether she accepts or declines your proposal. Acknowledge her feelings and honor her choice without resentment or pressure. Remember that a rejection does not diminish your worth as a person, and there are opportunities for growth and learning from every experience.

Give Her Time: Give her the time and space she needs to process your proposal and its implications. Avoid bombarding her with messages or seeking an immediate answer. Allow her to reflect on her feelings and make a decision without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.

Celebrate Together: If she accepts your proposal, celebrate this milestone together. Express your joy and gratitude for having her in your life. Plan meaningful activities or gestures to commemorate the occasion and strengthen your bond further.

In conclusion, proposing to a girl on chat requires sensitivity, empathy, and genuine connection. By following these guidelines and approaching the conversation with sincerity and respect, you can increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. Remember that every relationship is unique, so adapt these tips to suit your individual circumstances and dynamics. Ultimately, the key to a successful proposal lies in the authenticity of your emotions and the strength of your connection with her.</content>
