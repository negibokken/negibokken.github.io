        <content type="html">As part of crbug.com/40066882, https://crrev.com/c/4786107 introduced a parameter to bypass scope access validation on iOS, with TODOs to do the same on other platforms.

During a code review, bsazonov@ pointed out that this may not be the desired end state.

This bug is about reconsidering this decision and possibly coming up with a better replacement to fully disabling scope access validation.</content>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. open rule.style.html in google chrome or another chromium browser
2. open devtools
3. click the button (one or many times)

# Problem Description
You'll see that the text positioned on left: 150px, not 999px. That happens because in for loop construction we read the offsetLeft of the element, and therefore layout was calculated on this position. But after exiting the loop, we can see that the layout not recalculated, even css styles show that left is 999px, but getComputedStyle().left will show 150px.

Line `$div.style.cssText = $div.style.cssText;` will fix layout recalculation. Any change on element.style will force recalculate layout.
Properties that usually triggers recalculate layout like offsetLeft, offsetHeight or method getBoundingClientRect will not force recalculate layout.
Closed devtools will fix layout recalculation.
Starting Performance record will force recalculate.

# Additional Comments
I noticed that the CSSStyleDeclaration from CSSStyleRule will not works properly with opened devtools, but CSSStyleDeclaration from element.style works properly.

# Summary
Recalculate layout with rule.style change while opened devtools

2. Open codepen in safari and scroll down, video scrubs through the progress smoothly

# Problem Description
Hi there - 

This codepen ties the scroll progress to the video progress by tapping into currentTime. In the latest version of chrome this video doesn't scrub smoothly, it takes a few seconds to catch up and then "jumps" to the new time stamp.

# Additional Comments
Here's a codepen demostrating the issue. Thanks!

# Summary
Dynamic video 'scrubbing' with JS and currentTime not working since last update.

# Custom Questions
#### Which component does this fall under?
Blink&gt;Media

#### Does this work in other browsers? 
Yes - This is just a Chrome problem

        <content type="html">Hi team,

Based on previous 'check_static_initializer.py' has supported for ios (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4233899):

I find some static initializers in Chromium by xcode instruments (picture 1).
I try to use 'check_static_initializer.py' to check the 'Chromium.app' but it can't detect any static initializer (picture 2). I debugged and found that the variable 'rc' detected was 0.
I try to commit a cl 'https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5302978' to test check_static_initializers.py is or not worked. Theoretically it should not pass the CQ DRY RUN, but it passed.

My question is why the script has no effect on 'Chromium.app'. Is there any special reason or the script has been not worked?

Thanks!

But the trace is strange that chrome/browser/ui/views/location_bar/custom_tab_bar_view.h is appeared as child span of [chrome/browser/ui/views/frame/browser_view.h](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/ui/views/frame/browser_view.h) which doesn't include the header file.

https://screenshot.googleplex.com/Az3AKuKna7bcfDQ

Similarly, [chrome/browser/profiles/profile.h](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/profiles/profile.h) has child spans for chrome/browser/tab_contents/web_contents_collection.h and content/public/test/browser_test_base.h, but those are not included by profile.h as well.

https://screenshot.googleplex.com/Ahh2GvLT254YEWK

Why does -ftime-trace show such trace?

# Problem Description
Example video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4x85zqoJM
Turn on YouTube "Stats for nerds" and make sure av1 stream is played (like ID 399, 1080p)

I can confirm that Chrome is using hardware decoding for av1 on M3 since VTDecoderXPCService is active during playback. 

Screen recording of observed frame drop uploaded as attachment. 
Chrome on the right is choppy. 
QuickTime on the left playing the same exact stream and it is smooth. 

Also tested on Chrome Canary 123.0.6309.0 (Official Build) canary (arm64) and the issue persists.

        <content type="html">I'm currently trying to figure out the potential impact for the Swap-RFH-at-Commit project (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RXGDkrSWTfaeio76joXKWBLGDHAbiB48sHUdcTX6rdc/edit?usp=sharing). The main areas to investigate are its impact (positive/negative) towards FCP time and how long will it extend Paint Holding, as a result of swapping in the new RenderFrameHost earlier (when asking the renderer to commit instead of when hearing back from the renderer that the commit is successful.

From discussions with CSA and compositor people, here are some hypothesis that we want to confirm:
- Swapping RFH earlier might not affect FCP directly because the time it takes for the renderer to produce the first FCP frame will be greater than the time it takes to send the DidCommit IPC and embed the new RFH (i.e. swapping RFH is not a blocker for FCP). 
- Paint holding will be used for a longer duration because we swap the RFH earlier, but the time it takes to paint the first frame will be the same. This is a negative for security.

To confirm the above, we have some CLs to gather metrics:
- crrev.com/c/5192269 records the time it takes between compositor creation to commit and to the current RFH swap time at DidCommit on the browser side. With this, we can see how long the compositor waits for surface embedding (RFH swap) from the browser side, which can be improved with Swap-RFH-at-commit.
- crrev.com/c/5057424 records the time it takes between the submission of the FCP frame to when the surface gets embedded on the renderer side. With this, we can see how often the FCP frame waits for the surface embed (RFH swap) currently.

What's currently missing:
- Metrics on current paint holding duration (not sure if this already exists).
- Measuring the time it takes between navigation commit to FCP frame submission to DidCommit to surface embedding. I might add this in crrev.com/c/5057424 or make it a follow-up. This will help to estimate potential paint holding duration if we swap RFH earlier.


I'll probably make a doc soon  to try to make the relations between timings and metrics more clear and also gather input to see if there are more things to consider.</content>

        <title>When src in @font-face is local, it will cause local font files to be repeatedly loaded into memory, which will consume a lot of memory.</title>

        <content type="html">When a user installs a large TTC file and opens our webpage, OOM will appear.
Through debugging, we found that the following method of using @font-face will create an sk_sp&lt;SkTypeface&gt; instance and load the font file once for each size of text, which will consume a lot of virtual memory.
```
@font-face {
       font-family: MyCustomFont;
       font-weight: 300;
       src: local("PingFangSC-Light");
}
```
Reproduction steps:
1. Install PingFang.ttc
2. Use 32-bit chromium to open font.html
3. Create a dmp file for the corresponding Render process.
4. Use a tool similar to windbg to analyze the MEM_MAPPED type of memory in the dmp file.


By analyzing the code, we found that `sk_sp&lt;SkTypeface&gt;` in the above demo was created using `AlternateFontName::kLocalUniqueFace`. Can we cache the `sk_sp&lt;SkTypeface&gt;` created through `AlternateFontName::kLocalUniqueFac`e in `FontCache`? This avoids creating the `sk_sp&lt;SkTypeface&gt;` object multiple times.</content>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Navigate to MUI's official website and to the example for selecting countries. Link: https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/#country-select
2. Tap the autocomplete and select a country.
3. Observe the browser tab crashing with the "Aw, snap" error page.

# Problem Description
I and others are experiencing a recurring issue when using the Material-UI (MUI) autocomplete component in Google Chrome. The problem occurs consistently and has been observed not only in my own application but also on MUI's official website with their autocomplete component examples.

# Expected behavior:
The autocomplete component should function as intended without causing the browser tab to crash.

# Additional information:
- This issue seems to be specific to Google Chrome. The autocomplete component works as expected in other browsers such as Firefox.
- Upon checking the developer tools console, no errors are outputted.
- A similar issue has been reported on MUI's GitHub repository, but it has been suggested that this might be a Chromium issue. Link: https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/40877

# Environments:
Mobile: Google Pixel 6 Pro
Browser: Google Chrome 121.0.6167.178
Operating System: Android 14; Pixel 6 Pro Build/UQ1A.240205.002

In addition, it has been observed by others in MUI issue tracker mentioned above. This includes:
Chrome version 121.0.6167.101
Android 14; Pixel 8 Pro Build/UQ1A.240105.004

However, co founder at MUI was unable to reproduce the error with his Chrome Mobile v121, Samsung S20 FE.

A couple of videos are also available in MUI issue tracker thread. Like this one: https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/40877#issuecomment-1936167049

# Additional Comments
I have no plugins for Chrome on my Android.

# Summary
Chrome crashes when using autocomplete feature on website(s). Experienced by others as well.

# Custom Questions
#### Crashed report ID: 
No

#### How much crashed? 
Just one tab

#### Is it a problem with a plugin?
No - It's the browser itself

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Load the provided HTML file in Google Chrome (works with both file:// and http://)
2. Wait a few seconds while the page is "loading"
3. The tab crashes with "Aw, Snap!" and "Error code: SIGSEGV"

# Problem Description
While trying to research CSS exfiltration techniques, I stumbled upon a SIGSEGV when trying to load an HTML page containing too many CSS var() in a &lt;style&gt; element. For some reason, the crash seems to only occur if the number of vars is between approx 105000 and 190000. The page loads correctly outside of this bounds.

When debugging with gdb, the SIGSEGV occurs on a push instruction with RSP pointing to the top of the stack.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1.  Install google-chrome-unstable-123.0.6300.3-1.rpm from https://dl.google.com/dl/linux/direct/google-chrome-unstable_current_x86_64.rpm.
1.  Wait until there's a new update so that it notifies you to update because you've only installed the RPM, not added the repository URI.
1.  Select the prompt.

# Problem Description
If you install google-chrome-unstable-123.0.6300.3-1.rpm from https://dl.google.com/dl/linux/direct/google-chrome-unstable_current_x86_64.rpm and wait until there's an update, you'll be prompted to update because you've only installed the RPM, not added the repository URI. If you select that prompt, you'll be directed to https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/ rather than https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/dev/.

# Additional Comments
This is the installer.

# Summary
When Dev (Unstable) cannot update, it directs the user to the stable download URI, not Dev's.
