&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A B&lt;/div&gt;

span {
  display: inline-block; /** required */
}

div {
  white-space: pre-wrap; /** required */
  width: fit-content; /** required? */
  border: 1px red solid; /** visual aid */
}

# Problem Description
I have a `&lt;div&gt;` containing several `&lt;span&gt;` elements. Each `&lt;span&gt;` contains a letter ("A" or "B") or a space. I have another `&lt;div&gt;` that contains "A", "B", or space, but as a single text (no span wrapped).

For example, the following `&lt;div&gt;` separates each letter or space into its own `&lt;span&gt;`:

```html
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

And this `&lt;div&gt;` keeps everything together, like a complete sentence:

```html
&lt;div&gt;A B&lt;/div&gt;
```

Technically and visually, however, it should be the same content and width. Something like "A B".

However, at least in Chrome (Firefox works fine), when calculating the size of the `&lt;span&gt;` elements in the first `&lt;div&gt;`, we have the following (font: Times New Roman, 16px):

- `&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;` has a width of 11.563px
- `&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;` has a width of 4.00px
- `&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;` has a width of 10.672px

So, technically, we would have a total width of 26.234px. When inspecting this `&lt;div&gt;` in the browser, the displayed value is indeed this. So far, we can consider that it is within the expected standards.

However, the second `&lt;div&gt;` (`&lt;div&gt;A B&lt;/div&gt;`), which has the only difference of not separating the characters between `&lt;span&gt;` elements, the browser reports a size of 25.344px, a small but crucial difference for my application (a "visual fluctuation" of ~1px).

My question is: why is the browser rendering this incorrectly?

If we compare to Firefox, the first `div` (with `span`) has the closest width to the first `div` in relation to Chrome (Chrome: 26.234px in the first and 25.344px in the second, Firefox: 26.2167px in both) .

# Summary
White-space width inconsistency inside inline-block, impacting layout precision

My point is not why doesn't anything happen.

Sure the user might have disabled some of the apps in the chain of commands that are needed.

It doesn't matter.
My point is there should be at least a message.

Yes, you might say well it's not our problem. Well however this is your browser.
PS I'm having a very hard time entering this bug report by a cell phone. You should try it someday.

        <content type="html">In today's digital age, romantic connections often begin and flourish through online communication platforms. Chatting has become a prevalent medium for expressing feelings, sharing emotions, and even proposing to someone special. However, proposing a girl on chat requires finesse, sensitivity, and understanding of the medium. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the intricacies of proposing a girl on chat, offering tips, dos and don'ts, and strategies for success.

Establish a Genuine Connection: Before considering proposing to a girl on chat, ensure you have established a genuine connection with her. Engage in meaningful conversations, show interest in her life, and demonstrate that you value her thoughts and opinions. Building a solid foundation of trust and rapport is crucial for a successful proposal.

Choose the Right Moment: Timing is everything when it comes to proposing on chat. Select a moment when both of you are relaxed, and the conversation is flowing smoothly. Avoid popping the question out of the blue or during stressful situations. Create a comfortable atmosphere where she feels open to receiving your proposal.

Express Your Feelings Honestly: Be sincere and authentic in expressing your feelings for her. Choose your words carefully to convey the depth of your emotions. Avoid using clichés or generic lines; instead, speak from the heart. Let her know why she is special to you and how she has impacted your life positively.

Personalize Your Approach: Tailor your proposal to reflect your unique relationship with her. Reference shared memories, inside jokes, or meaningful experiences you've had together. Personalizing your proposal demonstrates thoughtfulness and reinforces the emotional connection between you.

Be Respectful and Considerate: Respect her boundaries and comfort level throughout the conversation. Avoid pressuring her or making her feel obligated to respond a certain way. Give her the space to process your proposal and express her thoughts and feelings at her own pace.

Be Prepared for Any Response: Understand that she may not respond to your proposal immediately or in the way you expect. Be prepared for a range of reactions, including excitement, hesitation, or even rejection. Regardless of her response, handle it gracefully and with maturity.

Follow Up with Communication: After proposing, continue the conversation and address any questions or concerns she may have. Reassure her of your commitment and willingness to support her decision, whatever it may be. Maintain open lines of communication to navigate the next steps in your relationship together.

Respect Her Decision: Ultimately, respect her decision, whether she accepts or declines your proposal. Acknowledge her feelings and honor her choice without resentment or pressure. Remember that a rejection does not diminish your worth as a person, and there are opportunities for growth and learning from every experience.

Give Her Time: Give her the time and space she needs to process your proposal and its implications. Avoid bombarding her with messages or seeking an immediate answer. Allow her to reflect on her feelings and make a decision without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.

Celebrate Together: If she accepts your proposal, celebrate this milestone together. Express your joy and gratitude for having her in your life. Plan meaningful activities or gestures to commemorate the occasion and strengthen your bond further.

In conclusion, proposing to a girl on chat requires sensitivity, empathy, and genuine connection. By following these guidelines and approaching the conversation with sincerity and respect, you can increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. Remember that every relationship is unique, so adapt these tips to suit your individual circumstances and dynamics. Ultimately, the key to a successful proposal lies in the authenticity of your emotions and the strength of your connection with her.</content>

jpeg xl was removed from chromium due to "There is not enough interest from the entire ecosystem to continue experimenting with JPEG XL" but now it has been adopted by whole Apple ecosystem. adobe, and Samsung on android, and even coming to windows.

I don't see it any reasons not to jpeg xl (JXL) to chromium project.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. open a page with a table with hidden text
2. select one line and press Ctrl+C = copy to clipboard
3. select the same line again = copy to xorg-server primary selection
4. compare the two clipboards

the order of steps 2 and 3 is important, because Ctrl+C would override the primary selection

# Problem Description
example:
copy-paste of github diff over xorg primary selection includes U+FFFC "object replacement character"

on the github diff page https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/3710916e2d5113fa975ab07b604a83d0c98510d3

when i copy the first line "Diagnostics:"

then i get these two clipboards

$ echo primary; xclip -sel p -o | hexdump -C; echo clipboard; xclip -sel c -o | hexdump -C
primary
00000000  44 69 61 67 6e 6f 73 74  69 63 73 3a 0a ef bf bc  |Diagnostics:....|
00000010
clipboard
00000000  44 69 61 67 6e 6f 73 74  69 63 73 3a 0a           |Diagnostics:.|
0000000d

note the extra "ef bf bc" in the primary selection
expected: the extra "ef bf bc" should not be there

"ef bf bc" = efbfbc = 0xefbfbc = U+FFFC = object replacement character
https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/fffc/index.htm
used as placeholder in text for an otherwise unspecified object

the extra "ef bf bc" always comes
after the linefeed character = \n = 0a = 0x0a
so there is always the byte sequence "0a ef bf bc"

the github diff view is implemented with an html table
where the left column has the style { user-select: none; }
so the left column is not part of the text selection

trying a minimal reproducer

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="user-select: none;"&gt;dont select me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;select me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

$ echo primary; xclip -sel p -o | hexdump -C; echo clipboard; xclip -sel c -o | hexdump -C; 
primary
00000000  64 6f 6e 74 20 73 65 6c  65 63 74 20 6d 65 09 73  |dont select me.s|
00000010  65 6c 65 63 74 20 6d 65                           |elect me|
00000018
clipboard
00000000  73 65 6c 65 63 74 20 6d  65                       |select me|
00000009

hmm. the extra "ef bf bc" is missing
but "dont select me" should not be in the primary selection

this seems to be an issue with html table
here it works as expected

&lt;span style="user-select: none;"&gt;dont select me&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;select me&lt;/span&gt;

xorg-server primary selection contains unwanted text from html table with style user-select: none

        <content type="html">Project Description

This project aims to automate the testing of touchscreens with Chromebook using a human motion robot (HMR). Currently, touchscreens or any other touchpad-related test cases take much longer time and are more expensive when going through lab testing. Developing and conducting these tests via a HMR saves half the cost and accelerate the testing time from 13 hours to 15 minutes.
The objectives of this project include evaluating and assessing the pass/fail of touchscreen test cases, developing automation scripts in tast/go for onboarding the Human Motion Robots (HMR), and implementing the HMR’s testing lifecycle to run and evaluate test results.
This work will be phase 2 of HMR based on eng prod regression. Phase1 was launched this year for HMR based stylus regression. That work was also done with the help of GSoC intern and it was a great experience for the candidate to learn handson go, taste.

        <content type="html">Greetings, 

I hope this find you well. I found this project really interesting to work on but am not sure about my awareness of qualifications needed to complete it. so, I hope we could discuss this.

 If I'm understanding project idea correctly, you need to change the method that erase user-data to make it NIST certified by using one of its well-known methods like sanitize command. Also need that method to be eligible to work while erasing device when reset to developer mode and add a feature to it to make it report to user about deleted device. Is that the whole thing or am I missing something?

 Also, I did some research about NIST 800-88, media sanitization, power-washing (reset), and sanitize command which require understand basic Linux commands, because it's likely operating in Linux environment (not sure if that accurate or not). I have good understanding of C++ and have some hand-on experience using it, but unfortunately, I'm not familiar with most of above concepts. So, am not sure what should I do in that situation? am I eligible to work on that idea or I need some improvement? your advice would be super helpful. 

I tried to reach the starter bug by search for it in "Search Chromium issues" but did not find it, so if you could provide me a way to reach it (if I'm eligible to work on it), I would really appreciate that.

Thank you for the time and effort.

Sincerely 
Mohammed

However, GoogleTest may eventually make Abseil a non-optional dependency, and at that point, Chrome will need to find an alternate solution. Most likely, this means tweaking the build to make Abseil flags usable in tests, but not elsewhere. The doc above discusses a hybrid approach that has some promise (and will hopefully be usable for fuzztests as well).</content>

This also happens in Version 123.0.6312.4 (Official Build) beta (64-bit)

1.  Create and load an extension something like this

    background.js:

    ```javascript
    async function f() {
      const tabs = await chrome.tabs.query({currentWindow: true});
      console.log('tabs =', tabs);
      for (let i = 0; i &lt; 2; ++i) {
        if (tabs[i].index == 1) {
          await chrome.tabs.move(tabs[i].id!, { index: 0 });
        }
      }
    }

    chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(() =&gt; {
      f();
    });
    ```

2.  Open two tabs.

3.  Click the extension icon. Go to the Extension setting page and click
    "Inspect views service worker" on the extension. The console log shows

    ```
    tabs =
      0:
        id: 12345
        lastAccessed: 1708745107023.334
        index: 0
      1:
        id: 67890
        lastAccessed: 1708745463493.528
        index: 1
    ```

4.  Click the extension icon **again**. The console log shows

    ```
    tabs =
      0:
        id: 12345
        lastAccessed: 1708745107023.528
        index: 1
      1:
        id: 67890
        lastAccessed: 1708745107023.334
        index: 0
    ```

# Problem Description
It shows that the `lastAccessed` time is bind with tab index, but not tab id,
which I don't think it is correct.

Expected behavior:
In step 4., the correct output should be

```
tabs =
  0:
    id: 12345
    lastAccessed: 1708745107023.334
    index: 1
  1:
    id: 67890
    lastAccessed: 1708745107023.528
    index: 0
```

# Summary
`chrome.tabs.Tab.lastAccessed` gives incorrect result after the tab is moved

5)  Open news tabs related to shopping (https://www.target.com/, https://www.walmart.com/, https://www.costco.com/, https://zellers.thebay.com/, https://www.croma.com/)
6)  Create group using any of the options (Organize similar tabs, Organize tabs or Organize tabs - i.e. from  TabContextMenu, TabSearchUI or AppMenu)
7)  "Something went wrong" error would show up.

Expected Behavior:  When we launch a group of shopping websites, Auto Tag Group needs to suggest a group name and allow the user to create the group.

Actual Behavior: Error:  "Something went wrong" error would show up when we try to create a group for the following websites:  https://www.target.com/, https://www.walmart.com/, https://www.costco.com/, https://zellers.thebay.com/, https://www.croma.com/

        <content type="html">HeapProfilerReporting has a Feature parameter for each process type, and each parameter is a JSON-encoded dictionary containing all the settings for that process. So it's possible to set per-process parameters from an experiment config.

But on the client side each of the Feature params have the same default, so if we change the default value of one of the JSON-encoded settings it applies to all  processes. There should be a separate default for each process.

The first implementation of this, https://crrev.com/c/5186976, was reverted because it caused the wrong parameters to be used in the network and GPU processes on Mac stable. The next try should be more careful:

* Find out what was missing in the test coverage of https://crrev.com/c/5186976 before making any changes.
* Don't try to be fancy and merge parameters from different sources. Just repeat the default values for each process param.
* Add hard-coded max probabilities so that if there's another error, the damage is capped.</content>

        <title>Mac arm64 devices flakily producing truncated images</title>

        <summary>-</summary>
        <content type="html">Both the M1 and M2 GPU testers are flakily producing images that are mostly truncated past the first few columns on the left. As an example, [this](https://chrome-gold.skia.org/img/images/069192562ac0cf76a6ae75e4606f31d3.png) is a sample bad image from the M2 tester, while [this](https://chrome-gold.skia.org/img/images/cf69bb78dda1402d745fe48673d3ee0e.png) is what the image is supposed to look like. [Sample failed test](https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromium/builders/ci/Mac%20FYI%20Retina%20Release%20(Apple%20M2)/7489/test-results?q=ExactID%3Aninja%3A%2F%2Fchrome%2Ftest%3Atelemetry_gpu_integration_test%2Fgpu_tests.pixel_integration_test.PixelIntegrationTest.Pixel_Canvas2DTabSwitch_SoftwareCompositing+VHash%3A683a6270689279ee).

This appears to have been going on for a very long time - I went back to the start of November 2023 still saw this. It might not be possible to track down a reasonable regression range.

This does not appear to be limited to specific tests. Some tests that this has happened in:

```
Pixel_Canvas2DTabSwitch_SoftwareCompositing
Pixel_GpuRasterization_BlueBox
Pixel_OffscreenCanvasTransferAfterStyleResize
Pixel_OffscreenCanvasUnaccelerated2DWorker
Pixel_WebGLGreenTriangle_NonChromiumImage_AA_Alpha
Pixel_WebGL_PremultipliedAlpha_False_NoOverlays
Pixel_WebGPUCachedSwapBufferInvalidatedShouldBeBlank
Pixel_WebGPUCanvasFormatReinterpretation
Pixel_WebGPUCanvasOneCopyCapture
Pixel_WebGPUCopyExternalImageWebGPUCanvas
```

However, there does seem to be higher-than-average repro in `Pixel_Canvas2DTabSwitch_SoftwareCompositing`, at least on the M2 devices.

The truncation seems to consistently happen after 24 pixels. This happens on both GL and Metal as well as ganesh and graphite.</content>
