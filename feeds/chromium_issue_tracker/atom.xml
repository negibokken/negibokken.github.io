        <content type="html">The attributes resourceID and initiatorID are currently not specified in the w3c resource timing specification. Once these attributes are properly specified, it would be beneficial to include a link in the codebase for improved readability. 
This update should be made in the third_party/blink/public/mojom/timing/resource_timing.mojom file.

        <content type="html">We use the native 'Eye Dropper' API whenever it is available by detecting whether the feature is available (by `'EyeDropper' in window`).

However, in Linux Wayland, the feature is reported available and we try to use it even though the feature is not correctly working there (b/40800718).

As a solution:
* The feature should not be reported available in Wayland until it is properly implemented.

As a workaround on DevTools side:
* We're going to bring back the EyeDropper experiment for people to use a workaround to disable using native eye dropper.

It would have been better if we could understand whether the feature is working correctly on DevTools side and automatically disable it if it is not working; however, it seems like there is no way to do this on JS side.

When online, open some page in a new tab in set. Now offline go back to that tab.

# Problem Description
When we were online we long tapped a link and told it to open it in a new tab in the same set. Now we are offline and want to look at that tab. But you don't give us the choice to see the file that got downloaded! We just simply want to see the file that got downloaded right from this tab without having to go looking downloads. The choice is just missing from this image that you see. By the way entering this bug using a cell phone is a terrible terrible pain. Really should have a new bug entry system that works on cell phones. Not just desktops.

# Additional Comments
On a cell phone I can hardly see what I'm trying to type in this box.

Further analysis showed that all clients were the google updater was updated (omaha 4?) had the same update issue.
Our clients need to a proxy server to connect to the internet and we defined that years ago via Group Policy.  Earlier this week several other 1000 clients got the new updater and they now show the same issue.
Checking with our network team we see no network traffic occurring at all from the devices when checking for updates, proxy server logs also no trace of any attempts.
Testing the update URL via curl -v  and the correct proxy works just fine. Removing the proxy policies and placing the device on a network that doesn't require proxies also leads to the updater working fine.
The logs do indicate it recognizes the policies and it 'says' it will use them. But there's no log entries showing it actually did (unlike the older log files)

OS                   : Windows 10 Enterprise

What steps will reproduce the problem?
Go to DevTools "Performance" panel, make a recording of a website, like https://www.daca-ledscreen.be/led-scherm-huren

What is the expected result?
There is a "Layout shift" lane in the report. It shows you when a layout shift happened and under "Summary" it will tell you Where From and To the element shifted (position + size).
See: https://web.dev/articles/debug-layout-shifts#performance_panel 
In earlier DevTools versions, the "Related Node" attribute showed you which DOM element was being shifted. And it allowed to jump into the "Elements" panel right where the DOM element is located.

What happens instead?
The "Related Node" attribute is missing.
Confirmed on Twitter (X), Barry Pollard said he experiences the same.

        <content type="html">By the end of Q1 we should have a design for the (DevTools) Extension API that meets the needs of Angular DevTools for

* inspecting elements,
* opening source, and
* inspecting function property inspection

across `&lt;iframe&gt;`s, as outlined in [Chrome DevTools Inspected Window API Limitations
](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12guWC9tTpcXlTOinz7CWq-Fal05q12GNvbBgafSZc-s).

The current options seem to be:

1. Teach `chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval()` about frame IDs and expose a way to map the frame IDs that fall out of `chrome.scripting` to the frame IDs that `chrome.devtools` uses (these are different IDs).
1. Teach `chrome.scripting.evaluateScript()` about the [Console Utilities APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/utilities) that are needed by Angular DevTools.

Both options have downsides and aren't trivial.</content>

Revision :b26aa52e7baaa4a74e0d3ed434826dd84c7c2fce-refs/branch-heads/6316@{#1}

OS: Win(10,11), Mac

Pre Conditions:
Login Successfully

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Chrome and Go to Settings and select Languages
2. Select Hindi in Google Translate in to this Language.
3. Add German to Automatically translate these languages.
4. Go to ebay.de and Observe it is showing in Hindi.
5. Go to Lanugages and select Telugu as Tranlate in to this Language.
6. Go to ebay.de site and Observe it is not tranlating the selected language.

Actual Result : 
The first selected language only showing after changing to other languages

Expected Result : 
The selected language needs to show after changing the Language.

This Issue is exists from M-113 onwards. So Raising it as a NR Issue.

Hence this is Non-Regression Issue, Making the Status to Untriaged so that the issue would get addressed.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Create a Chrome Extension
2. Call desktopCapture.chooseDesktopMedia from the service worker to get a stream id
3. Send it to an offscreen document and call getUserMedia with the stream id
4. Observe "DOMException: Invalid state" error when trying to use a stream id with getUserMedia from chooseDesktopMedia.

# Problem Description
I have a Chrome extension which has been updated to manifest v3 and it previously used the extension api desktopCapture. This is no longer possible with manifest v3 and I have had to move to the getDisplayMedia web API. Now that I am using this API I have had many bug reports for my extension because the select what to share dialog is not very user friendly as it can easily be missed.

A similar change was made for the tabCapture api.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Call navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia from an offscreen document in a Chrome extension.
2. Observe that the dialog can easily be missed and can not be cancelled.
3. 

# Problem Description
Please add the following improvements to navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia when used from an offscreen document from a Chrome Extension:
- Allow the request to be cancelled.
- Enable control over where the dialog appears or always display it on the window which is currently focused by the user.

Context:
I have a Chrome extension which has been updated to manifest v3 and it previously used the extension api desktopCapture. This is no longer possible with manifest v3 and I have had to move to the getDisplayMedia web API. Now that I am using this API I have had many bug reports for my extension because the select what to share dialog can easily be missed due to the following:
- If using multiple monitors it opens on the main monitor instead of the focused window.
- It takes awhile to open
- If you click on the window as soon as it opens it is hidden from view.
Another issue is that it is not cancellable and while the dialog is open no other streams can be opened.

Please see https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions/c/3RanHldyp9c from more info.

        <content type="html">Members of our partner organization (Jetbrains) have recently started getting errors when attempting to access the skia issue tracker bugs.  Example: https://issues.skia.org/issues/324465764. It seems like maybe a recent permissions change?

They are able to see the issue from incognito and from their personal gmail account, just not from their partner google account.  I think it's all bugs in the Skia tracker, they are able to see bugs from our other buganizer tracker (eg. partnerissuetracker.corp.google.com).

The possibility that this was related to age verification was raised, but sending the user to https://myaccount.google.com/age-verification says "you're all set" screen that says "you don't need to take any action because your Google Account doesn't require age verification", so that doesn't appear to be the issue.

The entire team compose team at Jetbrains is experiencing the inability to access the issue.  If you're looking at the logs, the user we've been working with while attempting to debug is  alexander.maryanovsky@jetbrains.com so he should show up in the logs.</content>

My name is Sahilsher Singh, and I am a 2025 Computer Science and Engineering student interested in contributing to the project focused on enhancing the WebXR Internals debugging page for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program.

Upon reviewing the project description, I am excited about the opportunity to build upon the foundation laid by the previous GSoC contributor and to further improve the WebXR Internals debugging page. The prospect of delving into real-time diagnostic information and high-level performance metrics aligns perfectly with my interests and academic background.

Here's a brief overview of my understanding of the project goals:

1) Last year's GSoC contributor initiated the framework for the WebXR Internals debugging page, incorporating logic to log session requests, active runtimes, and high-level metrics about XR sessions.
2) The goal for this year is to enhance the debugging page by integrating more diagnostic information in real-time, including live logs and high-level performance metrics such as live framerate and tracking dropped frames.
3) Additionally, there is a need to extend these metrics to include potential feedback mechanisms for the Google Cardboard VR runtime, as well as exploring the implementation of additional metrics for monitoring the general health of webpages.

I am particularly drawn to this project due to its focus on improving the debugging capabilities and performance monitoring of WebXR applications. As someone passionate about web technologies and virtual reality, I have prior experience in C++, Java, TypeScript and also  Access to Android phone which I think would be a perfect fit for this.

As I prepare to embark on this journey, I would greatly appreciate your guidance on the following points:

1) How can I familiarize myself with the existing framework and codebase for the WebXR Internals debugging page?
2) Are there any specific technologies or tools that I should be proficient in or familiarize myself with before starting the project?
3)What are the key areas of focus or priority tasks that you envision for the enhancement of the debugging page during the GSoC period?
4) Are there any particular challenges or considerations that I should be aware of as I begin working on this project?
5) How can we establish effective communication and collaboration throughout the duration of the GSoC program?

I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to this project and work alongside you and the project team to achieve our shared objectives.
