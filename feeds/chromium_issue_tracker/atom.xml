OS                   : Windows 10 Pro 

What steps will reproduce the problem?
Logging into ADP -&gt; Choosing Service Requests (Section in website allowed to see inquires to ADP representatives)

What is the expected result?
Expected to open page of open requests that can be clicked on and additional comments may be added to communicate back and forth with representatives.

What happens instead?
Red boxed error shows with bottom just loading continiously (even after deleting cahe and data). Box contains: Unexpected token '&lt;', "&lt;!doctype "...is not valid JSON
Attempted to try other browers and devices and same issues. On firefox it states: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data

        <content type="html">Before creating an unexportable key, it is checked if the required alg is supported. Sometimes even if it is claimed that the algo is supported it will fail with TPM_E_PCP_INTERNAL_ERROR during https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:crypto/unexportable_key_win.cc;l=112;drc=f4a00cc248dd2dc8ec8759fb51620d47b5114090;bpv=0;bpt=1.

It looks like this is always on specific virtual hardware.

As this affects under .1% of devices right now we just ignore it. I can see a few options of how to better handle this, and we need to do something as it happens on new trybots.

1. Handle fail key gracefully, for now that mostly means expect it can happen in tests.
2. Have a blocklist of known bad TPMs and disable ECDSA keys for these. RSA keys will work.
3. Create a config file, and if this fails once on this device disable ECDSA keys for this device in the future.
4. Always use RSA keys for everyone.

This bug tracks cleaning up the code that implements this flag. Please help us clean up the codebase :) If you need help or more context please get in touch with flags-dev@chromium.org.

This bug should be used for removing the flag entry in the flag-metadata.json as well as the code related to the flag.

This bug is generated based on the list of expired flags in flag-metadata.json file as per refs/heads/main@{#1262818}

This flag has been marked as expiring in M116 or earlier. This bug has been opened for the Eng teams to clean up the references for the flag in the //chrome/browser/flag-metadata.json as well as references to that flag.

This is a friendly reminder to help get this clean up completed.

If you think this flag needs to be extended beyond this milestone, please follow these steps:
- If you see a flag listed as expiring that you want to keep, create a CL updating //chrome/browser/flag-metadata.json with an appropriate new expiration milestone.
- If you do this before the M116 branch you're all set; if you do it after the M116 branch you'll need to merge that CL to the M116 branch as well.

        <content type="html">In accordance with //docs/flag_expiry.md, the flag "upload-office-to-cloud" has expired and been removed from the chrome://flags UI. This bug tracks cleaning up the code that implements this flag. Please help us clean up the codebase :) If you need help or more context please get in touch with flags-dev@chromium.org.

This bug should be used for removing the flag entry in the flag-metadata.json as well as the code related to the flag.

This bug is generated based on the list of expired flags in flag-metadata.json file as per refs/heads/main@{#1262818}

This flag has been marked as expiring in M124 or earlier. This bug has been opened for the Eng teams to clean up the references for the flag in the //chrome/browser/flag-metadata.json as well as references to that flag.

This is a friendly reminder to help get this clean up completed.

If you think this flag needs to be extended beyond this milestone, please follow these steps:
- If you see a flag listed as expiring that you want to keep, create a CL updating //chrome/browser/flag-metadata.json with an appropriate new expiration milestone.
- If you do this before the M124 branch you're all set; if you do it after the M124 branch you'll need to merge that CL to the M124 branch as well.

        <content type="html">In accordance with //docs/flag_expiry.md, the flag "launcher-local-image-search-ica" has expired and been removed from the chrome://flags UI. This bug tracks cleaning up the code that implements this flag. Please help us clean up the codebase :) If you need help or more context please get in touch with flags-dev@chromium.org.

This bug should be used for removing the flag entry in the flag-metadata.json as well as the code related to the flag.

This bug is generated based on the list of expired flags in flag-metadata.json file as per refs/heads/main@{#1262818}

This flag has been marked as expiring in M124 or earlier. This bug has been opened for the Eng teams to clean up the references for the flag in the //chrome/browser/flag-metadata.json as well as references to that flag.

This is a friendly reminder to help get this clean up completed.

If you think this flag needs to be extended beyond this milestone, please follow these steps:
- If you see a flag listed as expiring that you want to keep, create a CL updating //chrome/browser/flag-metadata.json with an appropriate new expiration milestone.
- If you do this before the M124 branch you're all set; if you do it after the M124 branch you'll need to merge that CL to the M124 branch as well.

        <content type="html">In accordance with //docs/flag_expiry.md, the flag "arc-sync-install-priority" has expired and been removed from the chrome://flags UI. This bug tracks cleaning up the code that implements this flag. Please help us clean up the codebase :) If you need help or more context please get in touch with flags-dev@chromium.org.

This bug should be used for removing the flag entry in the flag-metadata.json as well as the code related to the flag.

This bug is generated based on the list of expired flags in flag-metadata.json file as per refs/heads/main@{#1262818}

This flag has been marked as expiring in M124 or earlier. This bug has been opened for the Eng teams to clean up the references for the flag in the //chrome/browser/flag-metadata.json as well as references to that flag.

This is a friendly reminder to help get this clean up completed.

If you think this flag needs to be extended beyond this milestone, please follow these steps:
- If you see a flag listed as expiring that you want to keep, create a CL updating //chrome/browser/flag-metadata.json with an appropriate new expiration milestone.
- If you do this before the M124 branch you're all set; if you do it after the M124 branch you'll need to merge that CL to the M124 branch as well.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Open tab search (command-shift-A on the Mac)
2. Type a search term that is common to several tabs (in my case it was "drx")
3. Wait a few seconds

# Problem Description
The list of tabs keeps changing and re-ordering itself every second or two, even if you don't type anything else. This makes it very difficult to actually select one, as the one you want keeps moving around. I don't recall this being a problem before.

# Summary
"Search tabs" menu keeps changing order of tabs in list even when I'm not typing anything

        <content type="html">For M123, we haven't quite closed off all of the avenues by which a QUIC proxy might be used (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5253717). That support is known to be quite limited (`http://` URLs only) and at least a little bit buggy. But we're not sure it's totally unused.

Several CLs have since landed with the assumption that we would be removing this support:
 * https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5254679 (Remove enable_quic_proxies_for_https_urls)
 * https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5231469 (Refactor IsValidInternal to allow multi-proxy chain of quic servers for IP Protection)
    * specifically `IsValidInternal` in `net/base/proxy_chain.cc` now prohibits single-hop QUIC proxies
 * https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5241818 (Tunnel HTTP requests over QUIC proxies)</content>
