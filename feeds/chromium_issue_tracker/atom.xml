Intent-to-Ship: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/-SEMMttEqz4/m/ogpF3VZsAAAJ

Explainer
https://github.com/WICG/service-worker-static-routing-api

Specification
https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/pull/1701

Summary
This API allows developers to configure the routing, and allows them to offload simple things ServiceWorkers do.  If the condition matches, the navigation happens without starting ServiceWorkers or executing JavaScript, which allows web pages to avoid performance penalties due to ServiceWorker interceptions.</content>

        <content type="html">In accordance with //docs/flag_expiry.md, the flag "autofill-undo" has expired and been removed from the chrome://flags UI. This bug tracks cleaning up the code that implements this flag. Please help us clean up the codebase :) If you need help or more context please get in touch with flags-dev@chromium.org.

This bug should be used for removing the flag entry in the flag-metadata.json as well as the code related to the flag.

This bug is generated based on the list of expired flags in flag-metadata.json file as per refs/heads/main@{#1265538}

This flag has been marked as expiring in M124 or earlier. This bug has been opened for the Eng teams to clean up the references for the flag in the //chrome/browser/flag-metadata.json as well as references to that flag.

This is a friendly reminder to help get this clean up completed.

If you think this flag needs to be extended beyond this milestone, please follow these steps:
- If you see a flag listed as expiring that you want to keep, create a CL updating //chrome/browser/flag-metadata.json with an appropriate new expiration milestone.
- If you do this before the M124 branch you're all set; if you do it after the M124 branch you'll need to merge that CL to the M124 branch as well.

You can check the branch date for this milestone at https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule</content>

        <content type="html">In DevTool's console, you can change which frame is focused. By default, it's the top frame. Extension developers often change the focus to their extension's content script.

However, if you reload your extension and reload the tab, the old content scripts still remain visible. You have situations where there are 10 content scripts and you don't know which is the real one (it's not ordered). Only workaround is to use a new tab. 

This issue existed on Mac for at least a year.

Expected Result
Each click on a hyperlink or text field produces EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS event

Actual Result
Click on a hyperlink or text field doesn't produce EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS event

# Problem Description
Chrome doesn't produce EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS events on changing focused elements. That's why there's no way to get an instance of IAccessible of the current focused element.

        <content type="html">Some layouts will repeatedly ask a StyledLabel for its PreferredSize for the same small number of widths. Currently StyledLabel caches its last requested layout, but this still results in sometimes thousands of layout recalculations, resulting in one case a dialog taking several seconds of freezing the UI thread before it shows up.

Perhaps layouts in question could not ask the same question over and over, but it's also pretty simple to cache (a few) more layout sizes for the last several requested widths.</content>

1.  Launch Chrome Canary, navigate to any site ([https://liahiscock.github.io/PWA/MediaControls/App3]() used in attached screenshot), and install it as a PWA.

Just open IndexedDB in dev tools

The new delete database button 'trashcan' is too close to the refresh button . Iv'e deleted, accidentally, several DBs which I then have to manually recreate. It is so easy now to absentmindedly click the wrong button and then 'Wallah' another 40 dbs have bitten the dust and because my nerves are shattered I'm now working in Firefox!

        <content type="html">Our FedCMMetrics class is not reset when a FedCM call finishes, and we only initialize the IDP source and the session ID when the constructor is invoked. This means that we log all IDP-keyed metrics based on the first IDP we see in the page, even for separate get() calls. We should reset the FedCM member in between invocations, so that the session ID is different for different calls within the same page load. This would also help with the IDP key problem in the single IDP calls, but perhaps we can just pass the IDP to each individual method to properly support the multi IDP scenario.</content>

        <content type="html">Hello,

I hope you are doing well. I have just learned about the Google Summer of Code program and I'm interested in learning from you.

I have been taking a look at some of the links provided through your GSoC page and I am interested in the "Side Panel Sizing" project. The thought of working with you is exciting and I really want to learn. However, I am not sure about what I have to do because I've never contributed to an open source project before.

I saw that there are some bugs that I should work on, but how do I go about doing this? Is there a specific part of the Chromium repository on GitHub that I should look at and start reading the code? Are there certain technologies that I should become familiar with first and then fix the bugs?

Apologies if this is an unnecessary question. I know I have to submit proposals for the projects I'm interested in and I want to be able to solve the bugs you have listed, but I'm not familiar with the process. I would really love to work and learn from you and I hope it can happen. I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks.</content>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Go to https://jsfiddle.net/oz38s5fp/, click "Start", then click "Share".
2. Make sure you are sharing an external monitor and the shared content is not moving, as described in the problem description.
3. Mute state is displayed on the HTML page, and notice that it constantly changes between "true" and "false".

# Problem Description
Under certain conditions, Chrome will mute and unmute the getDisplayMedia video constantly (about once every 4-5 seconds). This seems to only happen if:

- The entire screen is shared
- The shared screen is not same screen as the browser (i.e. Chrome is running on a laptop monitor and an external screen is shared)
- The shared content is not moving

Happens on both Mac and Windows Chrome. Does not occur on Firefox.

# Summary
getDisplayMedia video mute state changes by itself constantly

# Custom Questions
#### Which component does this fall under?
Blink&gt;WebRTC

#### Does this work in other browsers? 
Yes - This is just a Chrome problem

        <content type="html">We can make the remaining steps of the O4 rollout more robust by not bypassing qualification when O3 is present and healthy.

--install is a separate issue since O4 --install can't hand off to existing O3.</content>

Version: 122.0.6261.69 (Official Build) (arm64) 

When the search bar is opened, the link/buttons nearby can’t be clicked. In the example in the image, the mouse can’t interact with "Code Review+1" below the search bar. I can interact with it on the right part of the buttons.
It’s an issue first because there is NOTHING that let see that this part of the UI is blocked. 
The same issue exists for example when the "added bookmark" view is opened, but at least when I tap outside of it, it close the view, so I understand what occurred.
In this case however, that does not close the search bar, which means that if I don’t guess I need to move the mouse further away or close the search bar, I would be blocked.</content>
