# Problem Description
There seems to be a WebXR immersive-ar events regression from 121 to 122. Touch events do not work anymore.
Before, regular "pointerdown" events were sent while in an AR session. Now, "pointerdown" events are not sent anymore. They do seem to still work on DOM-Overlay elements.

# Additional Comments
Works in r121

# Summary
WebXR immersive-ar events regression from 121 to 122 – no touch events anymore

# Custom Questions

Not sure - I don't know

#### Does this work in other browsers? 
Yes - This is just a Chrome problem

        <content type="html">Would be appreciated if this will be handled with high priority, since we are using this in productive with many customer clients.

Since the last Chromium Update (stable channel) from v121 to v122 our page to show Dashboards seems corrupt, in fact you cannot read any data from the statistics because the auto adjusted height seems to be overridden. First the issue was found on surfing with Microsoft Edge which also uses the Chromium engine, now the same issue with the latest Chrome version. One workaround can be to use the old Internet Explorer mode within Edge, so in this compatibility mode the view looks alright for the site. It was running alright for years, so we find this weird how an browser update can destroy such a stable running site.

How to reproduce the issue: 
1. Visit http://mobileaudits.de/DashboardReporting/eLPA%20Audit%20Planning?editKey=E1SKD
2. Enter with the credentials which I configured for this testing purpose. username: test / Password: test9
3. See how the height is overwritten, compared to how it should look like (comparison screenshots attached).

For any questions and tips I'm happy to answer.</content>

        <title>CFI + disabled Runtime Call Stats cause incorrect runtime calls</title>
        <author>
            <name>pf...@chromium.org</name>

        <link href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/327245456"/>

        <content type="html">This is forked out of https://crbug.com/327085705.

After https://crrev.com/c/5296143, enabling CFI + disabling Runtime Call Stats leads to a miscompile in `Builtin_RunMicrotasks` that causes wrong runtime functions to be called, `Runtime_PromiseHookAfter` instead of `Runtime_PromiseHookBefore`. Adding a non-sensical line of code to `Isolate::OnPromiseBefore` repairs the confusion.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Check out V8 on https://crrev.com/c/5296143
1. Build with the following gn flags (a reduced version of official builds on release branches):
```
dcheck_always_on = false
is_debug = false
is_cfi = true
use_cfi_icall = true
use_remoteexec = true
chrome_pgo_phase = 0
v8_symbol_level = 2
v8_enable_runtime_call_stats = false
```
3. Run `./tools/run-tests.py --outdir=./out/x64.official mjsunit/async-hooks/execution-order`

The test crashes because `Runtime_PromiseHookBefore` isn't called.</content>

1. use a recent version of Chrome on one of the mentioned Android phones
2. Go to one of the mentioned pages (Whoppah, Trivago, Transfermarkt), eg. https://www.transfermarkt.de/fc-bayern-munchen/detail/forum/10
3. scroll over the list items and see content or list items duplicated by the browser, sometimes multiple list items together are duplicated/repeated

# Problem Description
As described in this Reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/18rznms/chrome_on_xiaomi_phone_repeats_bits_of_a_page/), users with these and other Android devices (Xiaomi red mi Note 12 Pro, Samsung Galaxy M51, Samsung Galaxy M53, Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro Plus, Xiaomi 11T, see reddit for more) persistently and recurrently report duplicated website elements, especially on scrollable pages with similar elements such as user boards.
On reddit someone reports that switching the chrome flag http://chrome//flags/#ignore-gpu-blocklist did fix the problem, but as a developer of websites I can't force all of the users to do that. These website work well on other browsers (Firefox) on the same device.

# Additional Comments
As I wrote in the description, please see the Reddit post as well.

        <title>HTMLFormElement::CollectListedElements returns elements inside shadow DOM too aggressively</title>
        <author>

        <content type="html">Consider the following setup:

```
&lt;form id=f1&gt;
  &lt;input id=t1&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;input id=t2 form=f1&gt;
&lt;div id=shadowhost&gt;
  &lt;template shadowrootmode=open&gt;
    &lt;input id=t3&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

In this case, the shadow-tree-including listed elements of f1 should be `t1` and `t2`. However, the code currently returns `t1`, `t2`, `t3`. The reason is that:
- The explicit `form` attribute of `t2` causes `HTMLFormElement::has_elements_associated_by_parser_` to be set to `true`.
- As a result, `HTMLFormElement::ListedElements` calls `HTMLFormElement::CollectListedElements` with `root` parameter equal to the highest ancestor of `f1`, i.e. the document scope.
- `HTMLFormElement::CollectListedElements` thus iterates over all `HTMLElement`s inside the document and does not verify that the shadow DOM that it descends into is actually a child of `f1`.

Proposed fix: Before descending into shadow DOM, check that the shadow host is a descendant of the form for which we are collecting listed elements.</content>

        <content type="html">It seems like currently a lot (all?) manually uploaded Clusterfuzz issues (not sure about ones filed by Clusterfuzz itself) are stuck somewhere and aren't making progress on minimization or bisection, and no issues are being filed. Some examples:

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Go to https://faststream.online/player/#https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8 
2. Click the save button to save the video as an mp4. (I've also attached the resulting video to this issue but I am unsure if it will be the same.)
3. Drag and drop the video file onto a new blank tab to open it using Chrome's default video player
4. Open the developer tools dock
5. Seek around the video until Chrome becomes unresponsive. May take up to 30 seconds.

# Problem Description
MacOS: 14.2.1 (23C71)

Chrome will become unresponsive when playing certain videos with the DevTools open. Fixing this issue eventually requires force-quitting the app. The issue does not appear to occur when the DevTools are closed. It also doesn't appear to occur with some short videos generated by DaVinci Resolve.

        <content type="html">(Reported from Zoom)
After GPUExternalTexture 1-copy path has been updated from using DrawVideoFrameIntoResourceProvider() to CopyVideoFrameToSharedImage(), it fails to handle webcodec video frames which contains non YUV format(e.g. PIXEL_FORMAT_ARGB) CPU backed data. The reason is that CopyVideoFrameToSharedImage() employees VideoFrameYUVConverter to handle CPU backed data but it doesn't handle non-YUV format data correctly.

Tries to add back DrawVideoFrameIntoResourceProvider() path to handling such kind of cases.</content>

        <title>SVG gradient animation does not work properly on Chromium browsers</title>

        <content type="html">I am using an animated SVG on my website which animates the stop colors of the gradients within the SVG. The issue is that the animation seems to not be played at all, making the SVG stay in its initial state. It used to work perfectly before the most recent update. It still works on other browsers like Firefox and OperaGX as of my last checking, so I believe this issue has to do with the most recent Chromium update. 

I will attach both the code of the SVG and a short video showing its proper behavior:

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Navigate to https://mckltype.com/fort/#styles
2. Adjust font size slider from edge to edge (notice performance issues in the 80-130px font-size range)
3. Replace text via input with one character repeated 50 times (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
4. Adjust font size slider from edge to edge (notice NO performance issues in the 80-130px font-size range)

# Problem Description
I have an unexpected issue where the paint time increases dramatically when resizing text between the 80-130px font-size range. This issue only occurs on Chrome.

I've also noticed that if I reduce the variation in the characters, this issue goes away. Thats the strangest part for me... I wasn't aware of a correlation between Webfont character variation and performance.

I've tried throttling the resize event, reducing content shifts, and setting max heights + overflow to remove the total painted area, but none of that has helped.

This behaviour didn't exist a few months ago, so I'm pretty sure it's something that's been newly added to Chrome — possibly related to how fonts are being rendered. Does anyone know what it could be or how I can address it?
