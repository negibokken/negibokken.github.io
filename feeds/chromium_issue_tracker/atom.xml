        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. On a current Fedora installation install google-chrome-stable from the provided repository
2. Verify /etc/cron.daily/google-chrome is created, but no cron is installed
3. Cronjob will not be executed so no update of the repository and signing key will happen

# Problem Description
If you look at the filelist of the package you will notice the cronjob dropped at /etc/cron.daily/google-chrome, but looking at the requirements you will not find a requirement on any cron implementation.

$ rpm -ql google-chrome-stable
/etc/cron.daily/google-chrome
...

$ rpm -q --requires google-chrome-stable
...

Having a requirement on cron is only an intermediate solution I think as I see distributions moving forward on dropping cron in favour of systemd-timers, so dropping the current cronjob instead as a script in /usr/bin/ or somewhere under /opt/google/ and adding a systemd service unit of type oneshot started by a systemd timer unit would be the way to go on newer Linux distributions. 

Just as a reference if whoever is reading my suggestion is not familiar with systemd-timers: https://opensource.com/article/20/7/systemd-timers

# Summary
Drops cronjob without requiring cron

        <summary>-</summary>
        <content type="html">The Ragel generated emoji presentation scanner is mapped to working on top of `UTF16RagelIterator`. Increment, decrement and assign operations in the Ragel scanner (which usually access `chars` directly) are mapped to overloaded operator implementations. A change of cursor position leads to updating the internally stored emoji presentation category. 

Because the scanner internally performs assignments, which may include copy assignments, in some situations two `UTF16RagelIterator` instances are active at the same time. Due to the order in which the scanner increments them, it looks like we perform multiple emoji category lookup per cursor position in the input text run.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Go to prepared demo Service Now instance -&gt; https://dev203607.service-now.com

2. Login as demo user 
user_name: chrome.dev
user_password: Demo_password1
*if needed i may reset pwd - just let me know

3. After login with mentioned user creds go to demo created incident 
-&gt; https://dev203607.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/incident.do%3Fsys_id%3Da83820b58f723300e7e16c7827bdeed2%26sysparm_view%3Dess%26sysparm_record_target%3Dincident%26sysparm_record_row%3D1%26sysparm_record_rows%3D1%26sysparm_record_list%3Dcaller_id%253Djavascript%253Ags.getUserID%2528%2529%255Eactive%253Dtrue%255Euniversal_requestISEMPTY%255EORDERBYDESCnumber

Open page inspector (DevTools Elements) and try to find 2 locators with ctrl+f option.
1st. el. is inside gsft_main iframe, 
2nd. el is outside gsft_main frame.

eg. xpath locators for tests:
1) inside gsft_main iframe (expected) -&gt;  //*[@id="sys_readonly.incident.number"]
2) outside gsft_main iframe (unexpected) - &gt; //div[@id="1b682fe1c3133010cbd77096e940dd18"]

What is the expected result?
Inside gsft_main frame we're able to search for xpath locators as expected.
Expected results is that we will be able to find mentioned elements inside and outside gsft_main iframe from DevTools Elements tab

What happens instead?
Expected elements from outside gsft_main iframe are not visible in  (DevTools Elements not show any element which is in page source).
Outside gsft_main frame we're not able to find elements. (see screenshots below)
eg. xpath locator to "Favourites" button - &gt; //div[@id="1b682fe1c3133010cbd77096e940dd18"]

If any more details needed please let me know, i can prep live hands on demo to show an issue.

1. Open Discover view in iOS Chrome

# Problem Description
Sorry I didn't provide the Chrome version. I'm filing this on behalf of my friend (hope I can pass this to the friend and he can add more info). When he opened up the Discover view in iOS Chrome, it showed multiple parcel tracking (Fedex specifically) popups in the view. He has no idea what those parcels are. One of the parcels even had a tracking number looking like a test data (no.: 123456789012).

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. open rule.style.html in google chrome or another chromium browser
2. open devtools
3. click the button (one or many times)

# Problem Description
You'll see that the text positioned on left: 150px, not 999px. That happens because in for loop construction we read the offsetLeft of the element, and therefore layout was calculated on this position. But after exiting the loop, we can see that the layout not recalculated, even css styles show that left is 999px, but getComputedStyle().left will show 150px.

Line `$div.style.cssText = $div.style.cssText;` will fix layout recalculation. Any change on element.style will force recalculate layout.
Properties that usually triggers recalculate layout like offsetLeft, offsetHeight or method getBoundingClientRect will not force recalculate layout.
Closed devtools will fix layout recalculation.
Starting Performance record will force recalculate.

# Additional Comments
I noticed that the CSSStyleDeclaration from CSSStyleRule will not works properly with opened devtools, but CSSStyleDeclaration from element.style works properly.

2. Open codepen in safari and scroll down, video scrubs through the progress smoothly

# Problem Description
Hi there - 

This codepen ties the scroll progress to the video progress by tapping into currentTime. In the latest version of chrome this video doesn't scrub smoothly, it takes a few seconds to catch up and then "jumps" to the new time stamp.

# Additional Comments
Here's a codepen demostrating the issue. Thanks!

1. Open the attached HTML
2. Open Print Preview
3. Choose Paper size A5 and Custom margins (0.39'' all, bottom 1.6'')

# Problem Description
The bottom margin in HTML on the body is not respected. It's large enough to fit the footer however the footer overlaps the content. See the attached bad.png. Setting paper margin to e.g. 1.18'' renders correctly, see attached ok.png

It used to work fine e.g. in Chrome 84

# Summary
Print does not respect bottom margin

# Custom Questions
#### Does the problem occur on multiple sites?
Yes - Please describe below

#### Is it a problem with a plugin?
No - It's the browser itself

#### Does this feature work correctly in other browsers?
No - I can reproduce the problem in another browser

#### Which other browsers (including versions) also have the problem?
Firefox prints footer on the first page, it should be on the second page.

        <content type="html">Hi team,

Based on previous 'check_static_initializer.py' has supported for ios (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4233899):

I find some static initializers in Chromium by xcode instruments (picture 1).
I try to use 'check_static_initializer.py' to check the 'Chromium.app' but it can't detect any static initializer (picture 2). I debugged and found that the variable 'rc' detected was 0.
I try to commit a cl 'https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5302978' to test check_static_initializers.py is or not worked. Theoretically it should not pass the CQ DRY RUN, but it passed.

My question is why the script has no effect on 'Chromium.app'. Is there any special reason or the script has been not worked?

Thanks!
