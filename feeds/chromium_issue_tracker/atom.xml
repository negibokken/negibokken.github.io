* be signed-in with an account
* have a bookmark in your account 
* open the bookmark folder containing a bookmark in the account section.
* long press a bookmark
* tap share

Expected result:
* Seeing an entry named "Edit bookmark"

Actual result:
* "Add bookmark"

This is because, to decide whether the entry is "add" or "edit" it only consider the locals bookmarks.</content>

        <title>Passkey creation with largeBlob "preferred" fails if authenticator doesn't support large blob</title>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Call navigator.credentials.create(), requesting the `largeBlob` extension with a value of `preferred`
2. Follow the browser/OS UI prompts and create a passkey using an authenticator that does not support `largeBlob` (eg any Android device; Windows Hello; *not* Chrome's Virtual Authenticator Environment)
3. Despite passkey creation succeeding _at the OS level_ (because `largeBlob` is not set to `required`), the call to `navigator.credentials.create` will throw a `DOMException`

# Problem Description
When calling `navigator.credentials.create()` with an `extensions` property that requests (but _does not require_) `largeBlob` (that is, by setting `extensions.largeBlob.support` to `preferred`), a DOMException with message `The operation either timed out or was not allowed. See: https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-privacy-considerations-client.` will be emitted, despite passkey creation succeeding at the OS / authenticator level.

If I remove the `largeBlob` extension from the credential creation request, passkey creation succeeds as normal -- I have narrowed this down to the presence of this field.

*NOTE:* This does not apply if using the Virtual Authenticator Environment in Chromium's WebAuthn dev tools. Everything functions as expected when using the VAE. It is only when attempting to use an _actual_ authenticator -- platform or hybrid -- which does not support large blob that the issue occurs.

I have tested the following scenarios, all initiated by calling `navigator.credentials.create()` with `largeBlob` set to `preferred` on a Windows laptop running the latest version of Chrome:

- Create Passkey on Platform Authenticator (Windows Hello)
    - Windows Hello's UI indicates that passkey creation succeeded; DOMException thrown in Chrome
    - Expected result: Passkey creation succeeds in Chrome, but `largeBlob` has a value of `{supported: false}` in the client extension output of the created credential
- Create Passkey on Hybrid Authenticator (Android Device)
    - Android's UI indicates that passkey creation succeeded; DOMException thrown in Chrome
- Create Passkey on Chrome's Virtual Authenticator Environment
    - Passkey creation succeeds. Large blob's support is accurately reported, based on whether or not "Supports large blob" is ticked when creating a virtual authenticator.
- Create Passkey on Hybrid Authenticator (iOS Device)
    - Passkey creation succeeds. Large blob is reported as enabled and is fully functional.

Expected Behavior: The call to `navigator.credentials.create()` should succeed, but the value of `largeBlob` in the client extension output of the returned credential should be `{supported: false}`. 

# Summary
Passkey creation with largeBlob "preferred" fails if authenticator doesn't support large blob

# Custom Questions
#### Which component does this fall under?
Not sure - I don't know

#### Does this work in other browsers? 
Yes - This is just a Chrome problem

        <title>Disabling V8 optimiser in site settings disables wasm</title>

        <content type="html">Setting the "V8 optimizer" setting in Site Settings to "block" breaks wasm.

Google Chrome: 122.0.6261.49 (Official Build) beta (x86_64)
OS: macOS Version 14.3.1 (Build 23D60)
JavaScript: V8 12.2.281.15

Steps to reproduce:
* Check configuration is default: go to chrome://settings/content/v8 and ensure "Sites can use the V8 optimizer" is selected, and there are no sites added to the "Not allowed" nor "Always allowed" lists
* Go to a site that uses wasm. The attached sample page is hosted https://arw.me/testing/misc/wasmdetect.html
* Note that test page says "WebAssembly appears to be supported 🎉"
* Go to the site settings for the page, find "V8 optimizer" and change the setting to "Block"
* Reload the test page (which should have a "Reload this page to apply your updated settings on this site" banner)

What should happen:
* Page still says: "WebAssembly appears to be supported 🎉"

What actually happens:
* Page says "WebAssembly appears to NOT be supported 🥺"

This setting should have the same behaviour as --no-turbofan and --no-maglev. Starting Chrome with these options (--js-flags="--no-turbofan --no-maglev") does not cause wasm to break.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Open Incognito mode
2. Hit a website that offers HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 endpoints.
3. The first request will use HTTP/2.
4. Hit F5 to reload the page. The second request will use HTTP/3.
5. This bug is intermittent but when it occurs Chrome will send invalid request headers over HTTP/3.

I have never seen this bug when using Chrome with HTTP/2, nor with Firefox using either HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.

When I say "invalid request headers" I mean that:

  sec-fetch-site: same-origin
  sec-fetch-mode: cors
  sec-fetch-dest: script

(from a good request) is replaced by:

  sec-gpc: same-origin
  sec-gpc: cors
  accept: script

(in a bad request). Sometimes I get:

  accept: no-cors
  accept: style

which is obviously invalid.

Another clue... bad requests also contain:

  pragma: no-cache
  cache-control: no-cache

which good requests do not.

# Problem Description
See https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/issues/11420 for more information and debug logs

# Additional Comments

        <content type="html">I was randomly looking at the new (unfamiliar) replacement for the chromeperf dashboard (the Skia dashboard something), and started a bisect on a timeline where navigation_commit_time seemed to have a regression (30ms or so). I could not save the link to the graph, sorry, it was too complex for me to succeed on this task.

The [bisect](https://pinpoint-dot-chromeperf.appspot.com/job/16aba7551e0000) concluded and pointed at [crrev.com/1261843](http://crrev.com/1261843). It indeed shows significant differences, and the biggest % change is actually on `messageloop_start_time` (this fact I think would be useful when working on a fix).

Sky, can you please take a look?

The Pinpoint results are best viewed by clicking on the "Analyze benchmark results" link at the top-left. There will be a comparison between the two runs (with/without the suspected commit). On that deprecated legacy unloved page you will hopefully be able to find the impact on the metrics, with deltas and p-values. You can find links to traces on the Pinpoint page too. I click on those links reachable from Pinpoint jobs quite often - helps refreshing it in memory. If there is something you forgot or did not know about Pinpoint, let me know.

Oh, of course this is not a launch-blocking of a magnitude, but it's still worth a day to look for a fix ;)</content>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Create a &lt;div&gt; with 2 columns layout using "column-count: 2" css
2. Add inputboxes within this &lt;div&gt; container, adding "break-before: column" style on the 2nd inputbox to break the column
3. Add a &lt;div&gt; after the last inputbox (but still within the outer 2 columns container div) with "break-before: column" styling
4. Copy a big chunk of text (can be the page HTML code itself) and paste into any of the inputboxes

This will make the 2-columns container to shift to the left, hiding the content of the 1st colum

# Problem Description
When there is a container with multi-column layout ("column-count: 2+") and there are more column breaks than the # of columns -1 ("break-before: column" or "break-after: column"), and there are inputboxes in those columns, if you paste a big chunk of text in any of those inputboxes, the whole container moves to the left, hiding part of the content.
The issue only happens if you paste the content, if you just type a lot of content the issue doesn't happen.

# Additional Comments
The problem doesn't happen in Firefox or Safari, but it happens in Chrome (including Canary), Brave and MS Edge.
Tested on MacOS and Ubuntu, both has same issue.

# Summary
multi-column layout shifts content to the left when long text is pasted into input field

# Problem Description
My team and I have developed an automation tool named Automated Programming Sheet (APS) that employs Google Sheets as its user interface. APS combines Google Sheet formulas and Apps Script to automate tasks for users. Typically, a user could open a completed APS Google Sheet and resume working on it. However, in the past month, we have received numerous user complaints regarding the "Oh snap" error encountered when launching the Google Sheet. This error occurs regardless of whether the user attempts to open an older or newer version of our APS Google Sheet. Interestingly, when users open the APS Google Sheet in Firefox, this issue does not arise. My corp laptop does not replicate this issue so troubleshooting this issue has been difficult, but I have witnessed users display this issue.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
Situation:
The user has a lot of saved tab groups, and just saved a new one.

The problem:
But, the user isn't able to scroll through the list to find it.   The list doesn't fit on the screen, and its display can't be changed.

# Problem Description
Screencast of the problem:
https://screencast.googleplex.com/cast/NTE1NDM1NzA1Mjk2NDg2NHw4ZGY5NWFjZS01Nw

My versions:
Chrome version: Version 122.0.6261.49 (Official Build) (arm64)
MacOS version: 14.3.1 (23D60)

# Additional Comments
My recommended minimal fix:
The list of saved tab groups should be scrollable.

My recommended bigger fix:
Improve management of lots of tab groups.  You can either offer the user a way to fully customize it, or you can pick default organization system that is good enough that users don't feel as much need to organizer.  (Or both()
  - Good default idea: Organize saved tab groups into folders or sections within the drop-down menu of tab groups, organized by recency / use (e.g. tab groups saved in last 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, older).  Make the most recent category automatically be unfolded so user can see actual tab groups as a top-level item (Without needing to navigate through folders in this most-common case).
  - Customization idea: Let the user customize (like via the bookmarks editing menu), just as they can make a subfolder structure for how bookmarks appear in the bookmarks strip.

A bit more commentary and rationale for my suggestions:
What I proposed may seem overkill – isn't a simple drop-down with the names of saved tab groups good enough for most people?  After all, you probably have data showing that most users don't make a super large number of tab groups, to the point where they are hard to manage.
However, some users do tend to keep a ton of tabs open – you can see from my screencast I have 291. (My guess is ADHD people and PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) fans will be overrepresented in this group – and luckily for you, they both have chat groups where you can seek user feedback.)  And it's precisely these users who (a) will benefit most from tab groups being awesome to help manage and triage, (b) are likely to create a ton of tab groups.  In other words, this power-user-of-many-tabs is exactly the user group where you will create the most value and loyalty by developing out the feature (and also where you will learn the most from their expert usage, like how to build AI to triage tabs for others helpfully).

Other materials:
Similar bug is at https://g-issues.chromium.org/issues/41494513 
I realized this after writing my report and recommendations, so decided to file (as a private bug) even though it appears to be a dupe of that public one.

OS                              : ChromeOS 120

What steps will reproduce the problem?

I found two ways to reproduce a similar problem, this simplest way is the following:
1. Open a page with an iframe that has no JS, e.g. https://buttery-intelligent-phone.glitch.me/
2. Select the div within the iframe (by either clicking on it in the Elements pane or using the ctrl+shift+c tool).
3. In the console, select the "top" context and run "$0 instanceof Node" in the console (this will return true).
4. Now select the iframe context and again run "$0 instanceof Node" (this will return false).

And the second one, which is actually causing issues in our DevTools extension:
1. Open any page with an iframe.
2. Inject a content script only in the top frame (many extensions will do this by default - e.g. angular devtools, so you can reuse their context).
3. Select a div within an iframe.
4. In the console, select the extension context and run "$0.ownerDocument.defaultView". This will create a new extension context within the iframe.
5. In the console, select the new extension context (under the iframe) and run "$0 instanceof Node" or "document instanceof Node" (both return false).
Now if the extension injects a content script into the iframe in the future, this context will always be broken (instanceof will not work correctly).

What is the expected result?
$0 instanceof Node should return true when executing code in the context of the iframe that contains the selected element.
document instanceof Node should always return true.

What happens instead?
$0 instanceof Node returns true in whichever context the code is run first, and false in other contexts. Note that this doesn't just affect the code running in the console, but also any JS on the page.
document instanceof Node returns false in the second example.

Possible workaround:
Running some JS in each iframe before using $0. For extensions this means injecting a content script into every iframe.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. On a current Fedora installation install google-chrome-stable from the provided repository
2. Verify /etc/cron.daily/google-chrome is created, but no cron is installed
3. Cronjob will not be executed so no update of the repository and signing key will happen

# Problem Description
If you look at the filelist of the package you will notice the cronjob dropped at /etc/cron.daily/google-chrome, but looking at the requirements you will not find a requirement on any cron implementation.

$ rpm -ql google-chrome-stable
/etc/cron.daily/google-chrome
...

$ rpm -q --requires google-chrome-stable
...

Having a requirement on cron is only an intermediate solution I think as I see distributions moving forward on dropping cron in favour of systemd-timers, so dropping the current cronjob instead as a script in /usr/bin/ or somewhere under /opt/google/ and adding a systemd service unit of type oneshot started by a systemd timer unit would be the way to go on newer Linux distributions. 

Just as a reference if whoever is reading my suggestion is not familiar with systemd-timers: https://opensource.com/article/20/7/systemd-timers

# Summary
Drops cronjob without requiring cron
