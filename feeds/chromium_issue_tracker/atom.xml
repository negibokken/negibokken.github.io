        <content type="html">IsSkiaGraphiteSupportedByDevice() is structured to check `IsSkiaGraphiteSupportedByDevice()` before checking if `features::kSkiaGraphite` is enabled. This is to remove devices that can't support graphite from the finch study since they never check if the feature is enabled.

That is not working as expected because [this](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:content/browser/gpu/compositor_util.cc;l=227;drc=67db7ae4803bbf0ff439ee264dcfc23650e75aa8) unconditionally checks the feature status. I think that is why ~60% of the Mac/Intel experiment group is [still running Ganesh/GL](https://uma.googleplex.com/p/chrome/variations?sid=652a679566c36c546c86c57c0007fcd5).</content>

2. Fallback to default Android styling (using AOSP attributes) if the application hasn't set all needed attributes.</content>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Go to https://www.fressnapf.de/, which is a single-page application with the Soft Navigation Heuristics Origin Trial enabled.
2. Enter this script from [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/soft-navigations-experiment#how_can_i_measure_soft_navigations](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/soft-navigations-experiment#how_can_i_measure_soft_navigations) into the console in DevTools:

```js
new PerformanceObserver((entryList) =&gt; {
  for (const entry of entryList.getEntries()) {
    const softNavEntry =
      performance.getEntriesByType('soft-navigation').filter(
        (navEntry) =&gt; navEntry.navigationId === entry.navigationId
      )[0];
    const hardNavEntry = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
    const navEntry = softNavEntry || hardNavEntry;
    const startTime = navEntry?.startTime;
    console.log('LCP time:', entry.startTime - startTime);
  }
}).observe({type: 'largest-contentful-paint', buffered: true, includeSoftNavigationObservations: true});

```

3. Click on product tiles or content boxes to trigger soft navigations.

# Problem Description
# Current Results

* After some soft navigations, an LCP candidate ("LCP#1", which is a loading indicator) with a positive `startTime` and positive `renderTime` LCP candidates are logged to console followed by a second LCP ("LCP#2", which can be a hero product image) candidate with a `renderTime` and a `startTime` of 0; both LCP#1 und LCP#2 have the same `navigationId` as the soft navigation (see "screenshot-1.png" attached).
* LCP#2 is requested from the network (see "screenshot-2.png").
* If we send LCP#2 to analytics, we end up with negative LCP times if subtracting its `startTime` from the soft navigation `startTime`. 
* The `element` in the LCP#2 entry is null.

# Expected Results

* When multiple soft LCP candidates are registered and share the same `navigationID` and one candidate has a non-zero `startTime` or `renderTime`, any subsequent candidate should probably have a non-zero a non-zero `startTime` or `renderTime` as well.

# Additional Comments
I can also reproduce the issue on another SPA site, https://www.interflora.fr/ (see "screenshot-3.png" attached). There I have also seen LCP entries with a `startTime` and `renderTime` of 0 and a null `element` even when there is only a single LCP entry with the same `navigationId` as the soft navigation `navigationId`.

It looks like https://issues.chromium.org/u/1/issues/41489896 is a related issue.

# Summary
Some soft LCP entries have a startTime and renderTime of 0

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Sign into Company M365 account
2. go to myapplications.microsoft.com and authenticate
3. click on any myapplications tile. The tile should automatically authenticate since you have authenticated before.  
4. Instead, username/password and MFA code is needed each time that you open a tile.
5. 50% of the time, the webpage does not load and you need to reload it 4-5 times.

Troubleshooting done:
1. reset all browser data (all time)
2. Full re-install of Chrome (including all local data, and removing all Google related folders on the C drive and sub-directories)
3. Tried on VPN and non VPN

# Problem Description
The problem consists of multiple authentications to Microsoft and browser running at a slow pace.  In a normal scenario, you would only have to authenticate one time at the beginning of an 8-hour period as it would cache your login.  Each subsequent SSO application that you navigated should automatically log you in and authenticate you.  Instead, what is happening, is that each time you open another SSO application, you must enter your username/password/MFA code again each time you open the same or different applications.  Nothing has changed in our MS tenant that would cause this to break, as it works fine on Firefox, Brave, and other non-chromium based browsers.  Using Edge (which is chromium based) helps the issue slightly, but it still does not work.  the speed issues are also an issue, it takes 1+ minute to load some of the SSO applications when it would take 10 seconds before, this does not happen with the same applications on a non-Chromium browser. 

# Additional Comments
We use Microsoft M365 Subscriptions for our users and have not had this problem in the past

# Summary
Microsoft SSO not properly working on Chromium-based browsers, Constant authentication required.

# Custom Questions
#### Example URL: 
anything Microsoft SSO

#### Does the problem occur on multiple sites?
Yes - Please describe below

#### Is it a problem with a plugin?
No - It's the browser itself

#### Does this work in other browsers? 
Yes - This is just a Chromium problem

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(1) join a google meet meeting
(2) click the present button
(3) try to share a window
(4) Attempt to share a non-browser window in google meet (ideally my terminal, alacritty)


What is the expected result?
I can share the terminal

What happens instead?
I tried sway, gnome 3 and kde plasma

### Sway
* After selecting "window", no preview will display.
* If you click in the area where the preview would normally display, it shows a preview of the entire screen.
* the "choose a different window" button does not allow anything else but the entire screen appear.
* note: this does actually allow me to share the entire screen. I just can't select a single window.

### Gnome 3
* After selecting "window", no preview will display.
* If you click in the area where the preview would normally display, nothing ever happens
* If you select the blank preview window and try to share, it does not share anything

### KDE Plasma
My screen recording messed up so I will redo this step with more details. From memory:
* This actually works. The window pops up after selecting "window" with actual previews of separate windows.
* This did allow me to share, but something went wrong. The CPU usage looked so high I couldn't move the mouse cursor for several seconds. This might have messed up the screen recording.

I've attached dbus logs for each of these sessions. I have screen recordings in a drive folder. Please let me know if those are desired.</content>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Update Chrome from 114 to 115 or higher.
2. See this stupid new omnibox design that wastes so much vertical space!
3. Return it to the normal size before 2023 UI refresh.

# Problem Description
The problem is that Chrome designers make stupid decisions about UI.

After Chroe 2023 UI refresh omnibox height increased once again! Now it wastes even more vertical space. i mean, THERE ARE MARGINS ABOVE AND UNDER THE TABS! WHY? JUST WHY? What is the purpose of this new design? Maybe it works okay for people using 32 inch monitors, but for others it looks like a very dumb change. Maybe think about people who use laptops? No? Please!

At lease make a switch to return the omnibox height to the same size (or smaller) it was before the UI refresh.

# Summary
Omnibox height is too large

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
0. Nvidia 4060 RTX only, maybe it same on Nvidia 40XX series, I do not know, not tested
1. chrome.exe --use-angle=vulkan or /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --use-angle=vulkan
2. to test framebuffer format - open https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WscyRM 
3. to test video - open https://youtu.be/v8O2ZEeMiRE - video will be pixelated on 1080p+

Expected result on Shadertoy link is "23-bits" everywhere.
On Youtube - video not pixelated.

# Problem Description
I have tested/used Chrome in Vulkan mode on Nvidia 750, Nvidia 3080 - it work "as expected", buffers not 10-bits and youtube video work perfectly fine there.
This current bug/problem - is only on 4060.

Outside of Chrome - I can play 60fps 4k videos with not even 10% of 4060 GPU utilisation - youtube pixelated is not GPU problem.
Outside of Chrome - I use Vulkan and buffers there work perfectly fine - 32-bit buffers, no bug.
Also - in OpenGL and in ANGLE DX11 on this 4060 GPU - no these bugs.

And since Chrome in Vulkan works fine in 3080 - I think this bug related to "Chrome GPU blacklist" or something similar in internal of GPU-render of Chrome.

# Additional Comments
Screenshots of bugged result from 4060RTX in Chome in Vulkan:

# Summary
Nvidia 4060 - framebuffers and yooutube-panorama videos are broken in Chrome-Vulkan.

# Custom Questions
#### Example URL: 
https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WscyRM

#### Does the problem occur on multiple sites?
Yes - Please describe below

#### Is it a problem with a plugin?
No - It's the browser itself

#### Does this work in other browsers? 
Not sure - I don't know

This is probably because the wasm `rethrow` assumes that `Isolate::pending_message` is valid from the catch until the rethrow. But this isn't necessarily true (above example prunes the pending message by adding a `try { throw '..'; } catch (e) {}`.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Navigate to https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/live/PoLdbOX (this is a demo taken from https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/heap-snapshots)
2. Click "create scattered objects" once
3. Open up developer tools
4. Navigate to the "Memory" tab
5. Take a heap snapshot
6. In the constructors view, go to Item (which should have x20003 next to it) and expand this
7. Navigate quite a bit down to the 50th item and click this
8. In the retainers view right click "[50] in Array", then "reveal in summary view"
7. On the bottom in retainers  right click one of the leaf nodes and select "Reveal In Summary View"
8. Ah we meant to click the "X in Item", it's awkward to go back to where we were.

This is a simplified reproduction, but in some larger projects where you can go quite deep in the retainers view, it can take you a while to get back to your previous position.

# Problem Description
Investigating memory leaks is often a complex task: we frequently explore many avenues, expand numerous retainer trees and make use of the existing navigation features such as Reveal in summary view option.

However, if we find a dead end in our research or simply click something by mistake, it is difficult to recover the previous view. It would be very helpful if the heap snapshot browser allowed for back / forward navigation.

For example, if we use the Reveal in summary view option and then decide that this is not the object we are looking for, we have to manually go back to the previously viewed object and expand its retainer again.

# Additional Comments
## Gif
The gif illustrates the issue where we look at the retainer for "FinalizationRegistry" and click "Reveal In Summary View". Once this action is taken we can't get back to our previous position to look further down the retainers tree for "FinalizationRegistry".

2. Navigate to the performance panel
3. Take a performance snapshot for a few seconds and stop
4. When looking at the results, try to search for a span without using ctrl + F

# Problem Description
We have noticed some developers often don’t know they can search through the performance timeline, e.g. to find specific functions in the flame chart. This functionality is available through Ctrl + F shortcut, but it doesn’t seem to be advertised anywhere in the UI.

We think Chrome Developer Tools could improve this to make it clear that the users can search through the performance timeline.

The kebab menu in the top right corner does include a Search option, but this searches through the source files rather than the performance timeline.

This is new in the past couple of days, I think, so I'm regarding this as P0 in case some job is currently creating these duplicate entries and we need to stop it fast! If that's not the case, this can obviously be downgraded. I've no idea if this is just a UI thing (in which case it's unimportant) or the core ClusterFuzz database is actually being corrupted in this way, but the same problem shows up in Crash Statistics.</content>

Since I can't say if this is a test-only issue (noticed while gardening), I'm tentatively assuming it is an actual DCHECK failure and hence P1.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. open https://tiona.de/
2. install PWA
3. Open PWA, open console
4. In the console, enter next command: navigator.setAppBadge(2) and execute

ER: it sets badge with number "2" to the PWA icon

AR: it doesn't set anything, no errors in the console

# Problem Description
The problem is almost not reproduced on most of devices (Macs), but for some rare users the PWA badge is not set for no reason.

We are using window.navigator.setAppBadge(unreadNotifications) for setting PWA badge. It works for 99% of users and we had no problem with it. But for some special cases, sometimes, for some users in the specific site it doesn't work. We have a user, which has a stable reproduce of this kind of error, and nothing helps to return badge back. Even more, on the other site (our inner pre-prod env) it works for him (and for all other sites too). Both sites have exactly the same docker images and configs - so manifest, SW and other things are same.

In order to fix or reproduce the problem we have tried to:
- Manipulating with workers - deleting, updating, stopping
- Disabling all Chrome extensions
- Creating a clean Chrome profile
- Restarting the Mac
- Reinstalling the PWA several times
- Exploring chrome://flags
- Digging into Mac's system settings
- Attempted to incorrectly install the PWA (unsuccessful)
- Reviewed the documentation and potential issues - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Badging_API
- Reviewed current issues in Chrome - https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=setAppBadge&amp;pli=1
- Disabling the manifest to prevent SW registrations
- Turning off the internet/network

None of those steps helped with reproducing or fixing the problem.

I am out of ideas why this command doesn't work on exactly one site, but works for every other sites and the same site instance on the other domain. 
Please, if you know where should I investigate or what I could provide to understand the problem - please let me know.

Thank you!

        <content type="html">**Questions Regarding Contribution to Touchscreen Automation Project**

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my enthusiasm for contributing to the open-source community and my keen interest in the Touchscreen Automation Project outlined above. I am fully committed to dedicating my time and skills to see this project through to completion.

As I delve into the details of the project, I have a few questions that I hope you could kindly address:

1. As the project is focused on Chromebook testing, and I currently do not possess a Chromebook, would I still be able to contribute effectively? If so, what alternative methods would be available for testing my code without a Chromebook?

2. Could you provide more insights into Phase 1 as mentioned in the description? Understanding its specifics would greatly aid my understanding of the project's context.

3. The project description has left me with some confusion. Would it be possible to provide additional details to clarify the scope and requirements?

4. Is there already a satisfactory proposal or candidate for this project? I ask this to ensure that my efforts are aligned with the current needs and to avoid any unnecessary duplication of work.

I eagerly anticipate your response and am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this impactful project. Thank you for considering my inquiries.</content>

    unsigned int interval =

```

the `reading_callback_token_` check makes any further StartSensor() calls that occur when the optimal frequency changes in PlatformSensor::UpdateSensorInternal() not to do anything. In other words, as far as I can see once a PlatformSensorWin and an accompanying reader are created with a frequency, this frequency will be used until it is stopped. This doesn't affect the Win32 backend.</content>

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. Open PDF with narrow image masks (&lt; 7 pixels wide)
2. Print on a Postscript printer (PS Passthrough active)

# Problem Description
Chrome will wrongly encode narrow image masks with a width of less than 7 pixels, or maybe if they are small in general. For those, it will not use CCITTFaxEncode like for larger image masks, but only ASCII85Encode.
In the cases I saw, these were image masks in letters of fonts that use CharProcs where image masks are drawn, with a maximum width of 5 pixels, from 7 pixels on CCITTFaxEncode was used.
Correctly encoded, each line of the bitmap should be one byte, e.g. for a width of 4 pixels, 4 bits for the image and 4 bits padding.
Chrome, however, produces 4 bytes per line, with three extra 0 bytes.
On the Canon and HP printers I tested, this leads to undefined errors when printing, as the printer exits from the filter in the mid of the stream and interprets the rest as Postscript command. Ghostscript does not run into an error, but displays the characters incorrectly (several horizontal lines).

# Additional Comments
Attachments:
reduced_decomp.pdf is a PDF with decompressed streams, created from a real PDF from a customer with all identifiable information removed.
chrometest.ps is the Postscript created by Chrome from the PDF when printing to a PS driver with PS Passthrough.

# Problem Description
Chrome for Testing has a different Accessibility Tree comparing to the same version of Chrome.

The root cause is the `UiaProvider` feature. When I run Chrome for Testing with the following parameters ` --disable-features=UiaProvider` - it works as intended.
