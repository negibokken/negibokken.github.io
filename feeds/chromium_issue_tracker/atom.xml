        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
Situation:
The user has a lot of saved tab groups, and just saved a new one.

The problem:
But, the user isn't able to scroll through the list to find it.   The list doesn't fit on the screen, and its display can't be changed.

# Problem Description
Screencast of the problem:
https://screencast.googleplex.com/cast/NTE1NDM1NzA1Mjk2NDg2NHw4ZGY5NWFjZS01Nw

My versions:
Chrome version: Version 122.0.6261.49 (Official Build) (arm64)
MacOS version: 14.3.1 (23D60)

# Additional Comments
My recommended minimal fix:
The list of saved tab groups should be scrollable.

My recommended bigger fix:
Improve management of lots of tab groups.  You can either offer the user a way to fully customize it, or you can pick default organization system that is good enough that users don't feel as much need to organizer.  (Or both()
  - Good default idea: Organize saved tab groups into folders or sections within the drop-down menu of tab groups, organized by recency / use (e.g. tab groups saved in last 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, older).  Make the most recent category automatically be unfolded so user can see actual tab groups as a top-level item (Without needing to navigate through folders in this most-common case).
  - Customization idea: Let the user customize (like via the bookmarks editing menu), just as they can make a subfolder structure for how bookmarks appear in the bookmarks strip.

A bit more commentary and rationale for my suggestions:
What I proposed may seem overkill – isn't a simple drop-down with the names of saved tab groups good enough for most people?  After all, you probably have data showing that most users don't make a super large number of tab groups, to the point where they are hard to manage.
However, some users do tend to keep a ton of tabs open – you can see from my screencast I have 291. (My guess is ADHD people and PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) fans will be overrepresented in this group – and luckily for you, they both have chat groups where you can seek user feedback.)  And it's precisely these users who (a) will benefit most from tab groups being awesome to help manage and triage, (b) are likely to create a ton of tab groups.  In other words, this power-user-of-many-tabs is exactly the user group where you will create the most value and loyalty by developing out the feature (and also where you will learn the most from their expert usage, like how to build AI to triage tabs for others helpfully).

Other materials:
Similar bug is at https://g-issues.chromium.org/issues/41494513 
I realized this after writing my report and recommendations, so decided to file (as a private bug) even though it appears to be a dupe of that public one.

OS                              : ChromeOS 120

What steps will reproduce the problem?

I found two ways to reproduce a similar problem, this simplest way is the following:
1. Open a page with an iframe that has no JS, e.g. https://buttery-intelligent-phone.glitch.me/
2. Select the div within the iframe (by either clicking on it in the Elements pane or using the ctrl+shift+c tool).
3. In the console, select the "top" context and run "$0 instanceof Node" in the console (this will return true).
4. Now select the iframe context and again run "$0 instanceof Node" (this will return false).

And the second one, which is actually causing issues in our DevTools extension:
1. Open any page with an iframe.
2. Inject a content script only in the top frame (many extensions will do this by default - e.g. angular devtools, so you can reuse their context).
3. Select a div within an iframe.
4. In the console, select the extension context and run "$0.ownerDocument.defaultView". This will create a new extension context within the iframe.
5. In the console, select the new extension context (under the iframe) and run "$0 instanceof Node" or "document instanceof Node" (both return false).
Now if the extension injects a content script into the iframe in the future, this context will always be broken (instanceof will not work correctly).

What is the expected result?
$0 instanceof Node should return true when executing code in the context of the iframe that contains the selected element.
document instanceof Node should always return true.

What happens instead?
$0 instanceof Node returns true in whichever context the code is run first, and false in other contexts. Note that this doesn't just affect the code running in the console, but also any JS on the page.
document instanceof Node returns false in the second example.

Possible workaround:
Running some JS in each iframe before using $0. For extensions this means injecting a content script into every iframe.

        <content type="html"># Steps to reproduce the problem
1. On a current Fedora installation install google-chrome-stable from the provided repository
2. Verify /etc/cron.daily/google-chrome is created, but no cron is installed
3. Cronjob will not be executed so no update of the repository and signing key will happen

# Problem Description
If you look at the filelist of the package you will notice the cronjob dropped at /etc/cron.daily/google-chrome, but looking at the requirements you will not find a requirement on any cron implementation.

$ rpm -ql google-chrome-stable
/etc/cron.daily/google-chrome
...

$ rpm -q --requires google-chrome-stable
...

Having a requirement on cron is only an intermediate solution I think as I see distributions moving forward on dropping cron in favour of systemd-timers, so dropping the current cronjob instead as a script in /usr/bin/ or somewhere under /opt/google/ and adding a systemd service unit of type oneshot started by a systemd timer unit would be the way to go on newer Linux distributions. 

Just as a reference if whoever is reading my suggestion is not familiar with systemd-timers: https://opensource.com/article/20/7/systemd-timers

# Summary
Drops cronjob without requiring cron

        <title>Emoji presentation scanner maintains two UTF16RagelIterators leading to duplicate calls per codepoint</title>

        <summary>-</summary>
        <content type="html">The Ragel generated emoji presentation scanner is mapped to working on top of `UTF16RagelIterator`. Increment, decrement and assign operations in the Ragel scanner (which usually access `chars` directly) are mapped to overloaded operator implementations. A change of cursor position leads to updating the internally stored emoji presentation category. 

Because the scanner internally performs assignments, which may include copy assignments, in some situations two `UTF16RagelIterator` instances are active at the same time. Due to the order in which the scanner increments them, it looks like we perform multiple emoji category lookup per cursor position in the input text run.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Go to prepared demo Service Now instance -&gt; https://dev203607.service-now.com

2. Login as demo user 
user_name: chrome.dev
user_password: Demo_password1
*if needed i may reset pwd - just let me know

3. After login with mentioned user creds go to demo created incident 
-&gt; https://dev203607.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/incident.do%3Fsys_id%3Da83820b58f723300e7e16c7827bdeed2%26sysparm_view%3Dess%26sysparm_record_target%3Dincident%26sysparm_record_row%3D1%26sysparm_record_rows%3D1%26sysparm_record_list%3Dcaller_id%253Djavascript%253Ags.getUserID%2528%2529%255Eactive%253Dtrue%255Euniversal_requestISEMPTY%255EORDERBYDESCnumber

Open page inspector (DevTools Elements) and try to find 2 locators with ctrl+f option.
1st. el. is inside gsft_main iframe, 
2nd. el is outside gsft_main frame.

eg. xpath locators for tests:
1) inside gsft_main iframe (expected) -&gt;  //*[@id="sys_readonly.incident.number"]
2) outside gsft_main iframe (unexpected) - &gt; //div[@id="1b682fe1c3133010cbd77096e940dd18"]

What is the expected result?
Inside gsft_main frame we're able to search for xpath locators as expected.
Expected results is that we will be able to find mentioned elements inside and outside gsft_main iframe from DevTools Elements tab

What happens instead?
Expected elements from outside gsft_main iframe are not visible in  (DevTools Elements not show any element which is in page source).
Outside gsft_main frame we're not able to find elements. (see screenshots below)
eg. xpath locator to "Favourites" button - &gt; //div[@id="1b682fe1c3133010cbd77096e940dd18"]

If any more details needed please let me know, i can prep live hands on demo to show an issue.

1. Open Discover view in iOS Chrome

# Problem Description
Sorry I didn't provide the Chrome version. I'm filing this on behalf of my friend (hope I can pass this to the friend and he can add more info). When he opened up the Discover view in iOS Chrome, it showed multiple parcel tracking (Fedex specifically) popups in the view. He has no idea what those parcels are. One of the parcels even had a tracking number looking like a test data (no.: 123456789012).

# Summary
Unknown parcel tracking popup shown in the Discover view

        <content type="html">As part of crbug.com/40066882, https://crrev.com/c/4786107 introduced a parameter to bypass scope access validation on iOS, with TODOs to do the same on other platforms.

During a code review, bsazonov@ pointed out that this may not be the desired end state.

This bug is about reconsidering this decision and possibly coming up with a better replacement to fully disabling scope access validation.</content>
